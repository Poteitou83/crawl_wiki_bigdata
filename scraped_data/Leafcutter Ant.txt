Title: Leafcutter ant

Leafcutter ants Leafcutter ants are [fungus-growing ants] fungus-growing ants that share the behaviour of cutting leaves which they carry back to their nests to farm fungus. Next to humans, leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. In a few years, the central mound of their underground nests can grow to more than 30 m (98 ft) across, with smaller radiating mounds extending out to a radius of 80 m (260 ft), taking up 30 to 600 m (320 to 6,460 sq ft) and converted into 3.55 m individuals.
== Leafcutting groups ==
Leafcutter ants are any of at least 55 [species] species of leaf-chewing [ants] ants belonging to the three [genera] genera  Atta [Atta] Atta , Acromyrmex [Acromyrmex] Acromyrmex , and Amoimyrmex [Amoimyrmex] Amoimyrmex , within the tribe [Attini] Attini . These species of [tropical] tropical , [fungus-growing ants] fungus-growing ants are all [endemic] endemic to [South] South and [Central America] Central America , [Mexico] Mexico , and parts of the [southern United States] southern United States . Leafcutter ants can carry twenty times their body weight and cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as the nutritional substrate for their fungal cultivates. 
Acromyrmex Acromyrmex and Atta Atta ants have much in common anatomically; however, the two can be identified by their external differences. Atta Atta ants have three pairs of spines and a smooth [exoskeleton] exoskeleton on the upper surface of the [thorax] thorax , while Acromyrmex Acromyrmex ants have four pairs and a rough exoskeleton. The exoskeleton itself is covered in a thin layer of mineral coating, composed of rhombohedral crystals that are generated by the ants.  Amoimyrmex Amoimyrmex and Acromyrmex Acromyrmex differ in that Amoimyrmex Amoimyrmex lacks [tubercles] tubercles on the first gastral segment, and recent [phylogenetic] phylogenetic evidence shows that Amoimyrmex Amoimyrmex diverged before the other two genera of leafcutter ants. 
== Colony lifecycle ==
=== Reproduction and colony founding ===
Winged females and males leave their respective nests en masse en masse and engage in a [nuptial flight] nuptial flight known as the revoada revoada (Portuguese) or vuelo nupcial vuelo nupcial (Spanish). Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a [colony] colony . 
Once on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low, and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony. To start her own fungus garden, the queen stores bits of the parental fungus garden [mycelium] mycelium in her infrabuccal pocket, which is located within her oral cavity. Colonies are generally founded by individual queens – [haplometrosis] haplometrosis . Because colonies with multiple queens over the lifespan of the colony have been found by a large number of investigators – by Weber 1937, Jonkman 1977, Huber 1907, Moser & Lewis 1981, Mariconi & Zamith 1963, Moser 1963, and Walter et al 1938 – it is believable that some colonies have multiple foundresses – termed [pleometrosis] pleometrosis . Pleometrosis is confirmed only for Atta texana [Atta texana] Atta texana by Vinson 1985. 
=== Colony hierarchy ===
In leafcutter colonies, ants are divided into [castes] castes , based mostly on size, that perform different functions. Acromyrmex Acromyrmex and Atta Atta exhibit a high degree of [polymorphism] polymorphism , four castes being present in established colonies—minims, minors, mediae, and majors.  Majors are also known as soldiers or dinergates. Atta Atta ants are more polymorphic than Acromyrmex Acromyrmex , meaning comparatively less difference occurs in size from the smallest to largest types of Acromyrmex Acromyrmex . 
== Ant–fungus mutualism ==
Their societies are based on an [ant–fungus mutualism] ant–fungus mutualism , and different species of ants use different species of fungus, but all of the fungi the ants use are members of the family [Lepiotaceae] Lepiotaceae .  The ants actively cultivate their fungus, feeding it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from [pests] pests and [molds] molds .  This [mutualistic] mutualistic relationship is further augmented by another [symbiotic] symbiotic partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable [antimicrobials] antimicrobials .  Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it.  The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are [ambrosia beetles] ambrosia beetles and [termites] termites . The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so mutualism is obligatory.
The fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete. Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen [hyphal] hyphal tips ( [gongylidia] gongylidia ) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants.  Leucoagaricus gongylophorus [Leucoagaricus gongylophorus] Leucoagaricus gongylophorus is the most commonly documented fungi farmed by higher attine ant species. 
== Behaviour ==
Leafcutter ants have very specific roles in taking care of the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony's longevity. The necrotrophic parasitic fungus Escovopsis [Escovopsis] Escovopsis threatens the ants' food source and thus is a constant danger to the ants. The waste transporters and waste-heap workers are the older, more dispensable leafcutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger ants can work on the fungal garden. The Atta colombica [Atta colombica] Atta colombica species, unusually for the Attine tribe, have an external waste heap. Waste transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the waste heap. Once dropped off at the refuse dump, the heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition. A. colombica A. colombica have been observed placing dead ants around the perimeter of the waste heap. 
In addition to feeding the fungal garden with foraged food, mainly consisting of leaves, it is protected from Escovopsis Escovopsis by the antibiotic secretions of [Actinomycetota] Actinomycetota (genus Pseudonocardia [Pseudonocardia] Pseudonocardia ). This mutualistic micro-organism lives in the metapleural glands of the ant. Actinomycetota are responsible for producing the majority of the world's [antibiotics] antibiotics today.
Leafcutter ants use chemical communication and [stridulation] stridulation (substrate-borne vibrations) to communicate with each other. 
Leafcutter ants prefer [disturbed habitats] disturbed habitats , likely due to higher concentrations of [pioneer plant species] pioneer plant species . These are more attractive food sources because pioneer plants have lower levels of [secondary metabolites] secondary metabolites and higher [nutrient] nutrient concentrations than the shade-tolerant species that [will come later] will come later . 
== Parasites ==
When the ants are out collecting leaves, they are at risk of attack by some species of [phorid flies] phorid flies , [parasitoids] parasitoids that lay eggs into the crevices of the worker ants' heads.  Often, a minim will sit on a worker ant and ward off any attack. 
Also, the wrong type of fungus can grow during cultivation. Escovopsis Escovopsis , a highly virulent fungus, has the potential to devastate an ant garden, as it is horizontally transmitted. Escovopsis Escovopsis was cultured, during colony foundation, in 6.6% of colonies. However, in one- to two-year-old colonies, almost 60% had Escovopsis Escovopsis growing in the fungal garden. 
Nevertheless, leafcutter ants have many adaptive mechanisms to recognize and control infections by Escovopsis Escovopsis and other micro-organisms. The most common known behaviors rely on workers reducing the number of fungal spores by grooming, or removing an infected piece of the fungus garden and throwing it away at the waste dump (described as weeding). 
== Interactions with humans ==
In some parts of their range, leafcutter ants can be a serious agricultural pest, defoliating crops and damaging roads and farmland with their nest-making activities. For example, some Atta Atta species are capable of defoliating an entire citrus tree in less than 24 hours.
A promising approach to deterring attacks of the leafcutter ant Acromyrmex lobicornis [Acromyrmex lobicornis] Acromyrmex lobicornis on crops has been demonstrated. Collecting the refuse from the nest and placing it over seedlings or around crops resulted in a deterrent effect over a period of 30 days.
