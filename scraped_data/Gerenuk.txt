Title: Gerenuk


The gerenuk gerenuk ( Litocranius walleri Litocranius walleri Litocranius walleri ), also known as the giraffe gazelle giraffe gazelle , is a long-necked, medium-sized [antelope] antelope found in parts of [East Africa] East Africa . The [sole member] sole member of the [genus] genus  Litocranius Litocranius Litocranius , the gerenuk was first [described] described by the naturalist [Victor Brooke] Victor Brooke in 1879. It is characterised by its long, slender neck and limbs. The antelope is 80–105 centimetres (2 feet 7 inches – 3 feet 5 inches) tall, and weighs between 18 and 52 kilograms (40 and 115 pounds). Two types of colouration are clearly visible on the smooth [coat] coat : the reddish brown back or the "saddle", and the lighter flanks, fawn to buff. The [horns] horns , present only on males, are lyre-shaped.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The gerenuk was first [described] described by [Victor Brooke] Victor Brooke in 1879 on the basis of three male [specimens] specimens procured on "the mainland of Africa, north of the island of Zanzibar". Brooke used the [scientific name] scientific name  Gazella walleri Gazella walleri , on the request of Gerald Waller (who provided the specimens) to name it after his deceased brother. The [type locality] type locality was later corrected by [John Kirk] John Kirk , who originally obtained the specimens on the "coast near the [River Juba] River Juba in southern [Somalia] Somalia " before giving them to Waller. In 1886, [Franz Friedrich Kohl] Franz Friedrich Kohl proposed a new genus for the gerenuk, Litocranius Litocranius . The common name derives from the [Somali] Somali name for the animal ( gáránúug gáránúug ); the first recorded use of the name dates back to 1895. It is also known as the "giraffe gazelle" due to its similarity to the [giraffe] giraffe . 
Two [subspecies] subspecies have been proposed, but these are considered to be independent species by some authors. 
In 1997 [Colin Groves] Colin Groves proposed that Litocranius Litocranius is a sister [taxon] taxon of the similarly long-necked [dibatag] dibatag ( Ammodorcas clarkei Ammodorcas clarkei ), but withdrew from this in 2000. A 1999 [phylogenetic] phylogenetic study based on [cytochrome b] cytochrome b and [cytochrome c oxidase subunit III] cytochrome c oxidase subunit III analysis showed that the [tribe] tribe  [Antilopini] Antilopini , to which the gerenuk belongs, is [monophyletic] monophyletic . In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann and colleagues (of the [University of Cambridge] University of Cambridge ) revised the phylogeny of tribe on the basis of [nuclear] nuclear and [mitochondrial] mitochondrial gene analysis. The [cladogram] cladogram prepared by them (given below) showed that the [springbok] springbok ( Antidorcas marsupialis Antidorcas marsupialis ) forms a [clade] clade with the gerenuk; this clade is sister to the [saiga] saiga ( Saiga tatarica Saiga tatarica , tribe [Saigini] Saigini ) and the genera Antilope Antilope ( [blackbuck] blackbuck ), Eudorcas [Eudorcas] Eudorcas , Gazella [Gazella] Gazella and Nanger [Nanger] Nanger (of Antilopini).

== Description ==
The gerenuk is a notably tall, slender [antelope] antelope that resembles [gazelles] gazelles . It is characterised by its long, slender neck and limbs, the flat, wedge-like head and the large, round eyes. Males are nearly 89–105 cm (35– 41 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 in) tall, and the shorter females 80–100 cm (31–39 in); the head-and-body length is typically between 140 and 160 cm (55 and 63 in). Males weigh between 31 and 52 kg (68 and 115 lb); females are lighter, weighing 28–45 kg (62–99 lb). The species is [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic . The tail, that ends in a black tuft, measures 25–35 cm (10–14 in). 
Two types of colouration are clearly visible on the smooth [coat] coat : the reddish brown [dorsal] dorsal parts (the back or the "saddle"), and the lighter flanks, fawn to buff. The underbelly and insides of the legs are cream in colour. The eyes and the mouth are surrounded by white fur. Females have a dark patch on the [crown] crown . The [horns] horns , present only on males, are lyre-like (S-shaped). Curving backward then slightly forward, these measure 25–44 cm (10– 17 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 in). 
The gerenuk resembles the [dibatag] dibatag , with which it is [sympatric] sympatric in eastern and central Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia. Both are [brachyodonts] brachyodonts and share several facial and [cranial] cranial features, along with a two-tone colouration of the coat and strong thick horns (only in males). However, there are also some features distinguishing it from the gerenuk, including major morphological differences in horns, horn cores, tail, [postorbital] postorbital area and [basioccipital] basioccipital processes. The gerenuk has a longer, heavier neck and a shorter tail. A finer point of difference is the absence of an inward-curving lobe in the lower edge of the ear (near its tip) in the gerenuk. The subspecies of the gerenuk are similar in colouration; the southern gerenuk is the smaller of the two. The Gerenuk stages of growth have a timespan from 4 months to 2.5 years: at four months, their shoulder height is about two-thirds of adult female, at six months their shoulder height is about three-quarters of adult female, at eight months their horn tips are clearly visible (about 1cm long), at one year their shoulder height is nearly equal to adult female but body more lightly built, their horns are slightly less than half ear-length, then curve, at two years their horns are about 1.5 times their ear length and the second curve becomes noticeable with the tips turning forwards, and finally at two and a half years the double curve in the horns are nearly completed. 
== Ecology and behavior ==
The gerenuk is a [diurnal] diurnal animal (active mainly during the day), though it typically stands or rests in shade during the noon. Foraging and feeding is the major activity throughout the day; females appear to spend longer time in feeding. The gerenuk may expose itself to rain, probably to cool its body. The social structure consists of small herds of two to six members. Herds typically comprise members of a single sex, though female herds additionally have juveniles. Some males lead a solitary life. 
Fighting and travel are uncommon, possibly as a strategy to save energy for foraging. Both sexes maintain [home ranges] home ranges  3–6 km (1– 2 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 sq mi) large, and might overlap. Those of males are scent-marked with [preorbital gland] preorbital gland secretions and guarded - hence these may be termed [territories] territories . The sedentary tendency of the antelope appears to increase with age. 
== Diet ==
Primarily a [browser] browser , the gerenuk feed on foliage of bushes as well as trees, shoots, herbs, flowers and fruits. It can reach higher branches and twigs better than other gazelles and antelopes by standing erect on its hindlegs and elongating its neck; this helps it reach over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) above the ground.  Acacia [Acacia] Acacia species are eaten whenever available, while evergreen vegetation forms the diet during droughts. The pointed mouth assists in extracting leaves from thorny vegetation. The gerenuk does not drink water regularly. Major predators of the antelope include [African wild dogs] African wild dogs , [cheetahs] cheetahs , [hyenas] hyenas , [lions] lions and [leopards] leopards . 
== Reproduction ==
Gerenuk reproduce throughout the year. Females reach [sexual maturity] sexual maturity at around one year, and males reach sexual maturity at 1.5 years, although in the wild they may only be successful after acquiring a territory (perhaps 3.5 years). The [gestation period] gestation period is about seven months. They are born one at a time, weighing about 3 kg (7 lb) at birth. Offspring were produced through [artificial insemination] artificial insemination for the first time in 2010 at [White Oak Conservation] White Oak Conservation in [Yulee, Florida] Yulee, Florida . Four female calves were born, and one of the four was later inseminated successfully by White Oak and SEZARC (South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction & Conservation), creating a second generation of calves born from artificial insemination. Gerenuk can live thirteen years or more in captivity, and at least eight years in the wild.
