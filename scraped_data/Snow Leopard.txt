Title: Snow leopard


The snow leopard snow leopard ( Panthera uncia Panthera uncia Panthera uncia ) is a [species] species of large cat in the genus Panthera [Panthera] Panthera of the [family] family  [Felidae] Felidae . The species is native to the mountain ranges of [Central] Central and [South Asia] South Asia . It is listed as [Vulnerable] Vulnerable on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by [poaching] poaching and [habitat destruction] habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits [alpine] alpine and [subalpine zones] subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft), ranging from eastern [Afghanistan] Afghanistan , the [Himalayas] Himalayas and the [Tibetan Plateau] Tibetan Plateau to southern [Siberia] Siberia , [Mongolia] Mongolia and [western China] western China . In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
[Taxonomically] Taxonomically , the snow leopard was long classified in the [monotypic genus] monotypic genus  Uncia Uncia . Since [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among Panthera Panthera species, it has since been considered a member of that [genus] genus . Two subspecies were described based on [morphological] morphological differences, but [genetic] genetic differences between the two have not yet been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a [monotypic species] monotypic species . The species is widely depicted in [Kyrgyz culture] Kyrgyz culture .
== Naming and etymology ==
The [Old French] Old French word once once , which was intended to be used for the [Eurasian lynx] Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx Lynx lynx ), is where the [Latin] Latin name uncia uncia and the English word ounce both originate. Once Once is believed to have originated from a previous form of the word lynx lynx through a process known as [false splitting] false splitting . The word once once was originally considered to be pronounced as l'once l'once , where l' l' stands for the [elided form] elided form of the word la la ('the') in French. Once Once was then understood to be the name of the animal. The word panther panther derives from the [classical Latin] classical Latin  panthēra panthēra , itself from the [ancient Greek] ancient Greek πάνθηρ pánthēr pánthēr , which was used for spotted cats. 
== Taxonomy ==
Felis uncia Felis uncia was the [scientific name] scientific name used by [Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber] Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777 who [described] described a snow leopard based on an earlier description by [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon , assuming that the cat occurred along the [Barbary Coast] Barbary Coast , in [Persia] Persia , [East India] East India and [China] China . The [genus] genus name Uncia Uncia was proposed by [John Edward Gray] John Edward Gray in 1854 for Asian cats with a long and thick tail.  Felis irbis, Felis irbis, proposed by [Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg] Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1830, was a skin of a female snow leopard collected in the [Altai Mountains] Altai Mountains . He also clarified that several [leopard] leopard ( P. pardus P. pardus ) skins were previously misidentified as snow leopard skins.  Felis uncioides Felis uncioides proposed by [Thomas Horsfield] Thomas Horsfield in 1855 was a snow leopard skin from Nepal in the collection of the Museum of the [East India Company] East India Company . 
Uncia uncia Uncia uncia was used by [Reginald Innes Pocock] Reginald Innes Pocock in 1930 when he reviewed skins and skulls of Panthera Panthera species from Asia. He also described morphological differences between snow leopard and leopard skins.  Panthera baikalensis-romanii Panthera baikalensis-romanii proposed by a Russian scientist in 2000 was a dark brown snow leopard skin from the [Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky District] Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky District in southern [Transbaikal] Transbaikal . 
The snow leopard was long classified in the [monotypic genus] monotypic genus  Uncia Uncia . They were subordinated to the genus Panthera Panthera based on results of [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies. 
Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for the recognition of [subspecies] subspecies . Results of a [phylogeographic] phylogeographic analysis indicate that three subspecies should be recognised: 
This view has been both contested and supported by different researchers. 
An extinct subspecies Panthera uncia pyrenaica [Panthera uncia pyrenaica] Panthera uncia pyrenaica was described in 2022 based on [fossil] fossil material found in France that was dated to the early [Middle Pleistocene] Middle Pleistocene around [0.57 to 0.53] 0.57 to 0.53 million years ago . 
== Evolution ==
Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the [DNA sequence] DNA sequence sampled across the living [Felidae] Felidae , the snow leopard forms a [sister group] sister group with the [tiger] tiger ( P. tigris P. tigris ). The [genetic divergence] genetic divergence time of this group is estimated at [4.62 to 1.82] 4.62 to 1.82 million years ago . The snow leopard and the tiger probably diverged between [3.7 to 2.7] 3.7 to 2.7 million years ago .  Panthera Panthera originates most likely in northern Central Asia. Panthera blytheae [Panthera blytheae] Panthera blytheae  [excavated] excavated in western Tibet's [Ngari Prefecture] Ngari Prefecture has been initially described the oldest known Panthera Panthera species and exhibits skull characteristics similar to the snow leopard, though its taxonomic placement has been disputed by other researchers who suggest that the species likely belongs to a different genus. The [mitochondrial genomes] mitochondrial genomes of the snow leopard, the leopard and the [lion] lion ( P. leo P. leo ) are more similar to each other than their [nuclear genomes] nuclear genomes , indicating that their ancestors [hybridised] hybridised at some point in their [evolution] evolution . 
Fossils of the snow leopard found in the Pabbi Hills of Pakistan were dated to the [Early Pleistocene] Early Pleistocene . 
== Characteristics ==
The snow leopard's fur is whitish to grey with black spots on the head and neck, with larger [rosettes] rosettes on the back, [flanks] flanks and bushy tail. Its [muzzle] muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its [nasal cavities] nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs measuring 5 to 12 cm (2.0 to 4.7 in) in length, and its underbelly is whitish. They are stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than other cats of the genus Panthera Panthera , reaching a shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail is 80 to 105 cm (31 to 41 in) long. Males average 45 to 55 kg (99 to 121 lb), and females 35 to 40 kg (77 to 88 lb). Occasionally, large males reaching 75 kg (165 lb) have been recorded, and small females under 25 kg (55 lb). Its [canine teeth] canine teeth are 28.6 mm (1.13 in) long and are more slender than those of the other Panthera Panthera species. 
The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in cold, mountainous environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss, and its broad paws effectively distribute the body weight for walking on snow. Fur on the undersides of the paws enhances its grip on steep and unstable surfaces, and helps to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps the cat to balance in rocky terrain. The tail is very thick due to fat storage, and is covered in a thick layer of fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep. 
The snow leopard differs from the other Panthera Panthera species by a shorter muzzle, an elevated [forehead] forehead , a vertical chin and a less developed posterior process of the lower [jaw] jaw . Despite its partly [ossified] ossified  [hyoid bone] hyoid bone , a snow leopard cannot [roar] roar , as its 9 mm (0.35 in) short [vocal folds] vocal folds provide little resistance to airflow. Its nasal openings are large in relation to the length of its [skull] skull and width of its [palate] palate ; thanks to their size the volume of air inhaled with each breath is optimised, and the cold dry air becomes warmer. It is not especially adapted to [high-altitude hypoxia] high-altitude hypoxia . 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The snow leopard is distributed from the west of [Lake Baikal] Lake Baikal through southern Siberia, in the [Kunlun Mountains] Kunlun Mountains , Altai Mountains, [Sayan] Sayan and [Tannu-Ola Mountains] Tannu-Ola Mountains , in the [Tian Shan] Tian Shan , through [Tajikistan] Tajikistan , [Kyrgyzstan] Kyrgyzstan , [Uzbekistan] Uzbekistan and [Kazakhstan] Kazakhstan to the [Hindu Kush] Hindu Kush in eastern Afghanistan, [Karakoram] Karakoram in northern [Pakistan] Pakistan , in the [Pamir Mountains] Pamir Mountains , the Tibetan Plateau and in the high elevations of the [Himalayas] Himalayas in [India] India , [Nepal] Nepal and [Bhutan] Bhutan . In Mongolia, they inhabit the Mongolian and Gobi Altai Mountains and the [Khangai Mountains] Khangai Mountains . In [Tibet] Tibet , they occur up to the [Altyn-Tagh] Altyn-Tagh in the north. They inhabit [alpine] alpine and [subalpine zones] subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500 m (9,800 to 14,800 ft), but also lives at lower elevations in the northern part of their range. 
Potential snow leopard habitat in the Indian Himalayas is estimated at less than 90,000 km (35,000 sq mi) in [Jammu and Kashmir] Jammu and Kashmir , [Ladakh] Ladakh , [Uttarakhand] Uttarakhand , [Himachal Pradesh] Himachal Pradesh , [Sikkim] Sikkim and [Arunachal Pradesh] Arunachal Pradesh , of which about 34,000 km (13,000 sq mi) is considered good habitat, and 14.4% is protected. In the beginning of the 1990s, the Indian snow leopard population was estimated at 200–600 individuals living across about 25 protected areas. The Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India (SPAI) Programme counted the number of snow leopards between 2019 and 2023 and found their number to be 718, with 477 in [Ladakh] Ladakh , 124 in [Uttarakhand] Uttarakhand , 51 in Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Arunachal Pradesh, 21 in Sikkim, and nine in Jammu and Kashmir. 
In summer, the snow leopard usually lives above the [tree line] tree line on [alpine meadows] alpine meadows and in rocky regions at elevations of 2,700 to 6,000 m (8,900 to 19,700 ft). In winter, they descend to elevations around 1,200 to 2,000 m (3,900 to 6,600 ft). They prefer rocky, broken terrain, and can move in 85 cm (33 in) deep snow, but prefers to use existing trails made by other animals. 
Snow leopards were recorded by [camera traps] camera traps at 16 locations in northeastern Afghanistan's isolated [Wakhan Corridor] Wakhan Corridor . 
== Behavior and ecology ==
The snow leopard's vocalizations include meowing, grunting, [prusten] prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling. 
It is [solitary] solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. They mostly rest near cliffs and ridges that provide vantage points and shade. In Nepal's [Shey Phoksundo National Park] Shey Phoksundo National Park , the home ranges of five adult [radio-collared] radio-collared snow leopards largely overlapped, though they rarely met. Their individual home ranges ranged from 12 to 39 km (4.6 to 15.1 sq mi). Males moved between 0.5 and 5.45 km (0.31 and 3.39 mi) per day, and females between 0.2 and 2.25 km (0.12 and 1.40 mi), measured in straight lines between survey points. Since they often zigzagged in the precipitous terrain, they actually moved up to 7 km (4.3 mi) in a single night. Up to 10 individuals inhabit an area of 100 km (39 sq mi); in habitats with sparse prey, an area of 1,000 km (390 sq mi) usually supports only five individuals. 
A study in the [Gobi Desert] Gobi Desert from 2008 to 2014 revealed that adult males used a mean home range of 144–270 km (56–104 sq mi), while adult females ranged in areas of 83–165 km (32–64 sq mi). Their home ranges overlapped less than 20%. These results indicate that about 40% of the 170 protected areas in their range countries are smaller than the home range of a single male snow leopard. 
Snow leopards leave [scent marks] scent marks to indicate their territories and common travel routes. They scrape the ground with the hind feet before depositing [urine] urine or [feces] feces , but also [spray] spray urine onto rocks. Their urine contains many characteristic low molecular weight compounds with diverse functional groups including [pentanol] pentanol , [hexanol] hexanol , [heptanol] heptanol , [3-octanone] 3-octanone , [nonanal] nonanal and [indole] indole , which possibly play a role in chemical communication. 
=== Hunting and diet ===
The snow leopard is a [carnivore] carnivore and actively [hunts] hunts its [prey] prey . Its preferred wild prey species are [Himalayan blue sheep] Himalayan blue sheep ( Pseudois nayaur Pseudois nayaur ), [Himalayan tahr] Himalayan tahr ( Hemitragus jemlahicus Hemitragus jemlahicus ), [argali] argali ( Ovis ammon Ovis ammon ), [markhor] markhor ( Capra falconeri Capra falconeri ) and [wild goat] wild goat ( C. aegagrus C. aegagrus ). It also preys on domestic livestock. It prefers prey ranging in weight from 36 to 76 kg (79 to 168 lb), but also hunts smaller mammals such as [Himalayan marmot] Himalayan marmot ( Marmota himalayana Marmota himalayana ), [pika] pika and [vole] vole species. Its diet depends on prey availability and varies across its range and season. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on Himalayan blue sheep, [Siberian ibex] Siberian ibex ( C. sibirica C. sibirica ), [white-bellied musk deer] white-bellied musk deer ( Moschus leucogaster Moschus leucogaster ) and [wild boar] wild boar ( Sus scrofa Sus scrofa ). In the [Karakoram] Karakoram , [Tian Shan] Tian Shan , Altai and Mongolia's Tost Mountains, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex, [Thorold's deer] Thorold's deer ( Cervus albirostris Cervus albirostris ), [Siberian roe deer] Siberian roe deer ( Capreolus pygargus Capreolus pygargus ) and argali. Snow leopard feces collected in northern Pakistan also contained remains of [rhesus macaque] rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta Macaca mulatta ), [masked palm civet] masked palm civet ( Paguma larvata Paguma larvata ), [Cape hare] Cape hare ( Lepus capensis Lepus capensis ), [house mouse] house mouse ( Mus musculus Mus musculus ), [Kashmir field mouse] Kashmir field mouse ( Apodemus rusiges Apodemus rusiges ), [grey dwarf hamster] grey dwarf hamster ( Cricetulus migratorius Cricetulus migratorius ) and [Turkestan rat] Turkestan rat ( Rattus pyctoris Rattus pyctoris ). In 2017, a snow leopard was photographed carrying a freshly killed [woolly flying squirrel] woolly flying squirrel ( Eupetaurus cinereus Eupetaurus cinereus ) near [Gangotri National Park] Gangotri National Park . In Mongolia, [domestic sheep] domestic sheep comprises less than 20% of its diet, although wild prey has been reduced and interactions with people are common. It is capable of killing most ungulates in its habitat, with the probable exception of the adult male [wild yak] wild yak . It also eats grass and twigs. 
The snow leopard actively pursues prey down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of its initial leap to chase animals for up to 300 m (980 ft). Then it drags the prey to a safe location and consumes all edible parts of the carcass. It can survive on a single Himalayan blue sheep for two weeks before hunting again, and one adult individual apparently needs 20–30 adult blue sheep per year. Snow leopards have been recorded to hunt successfully in pairs, especially mating pairs. 
The snow leopard is easily driven away from livestock and readily abandons kills, often without defending itself. Only two attacks on humans have been reported, both near [Almaty] Almaty in Kazakhstan, and neither were fatal. In 1940, a [rabid] rabid snow leopard attacked two men; and an old, toothless [emaciated] emaciated individual attacked a person passing by. 
=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Snow leopards become [sexually mature] sexually mature at two to three years, and normally live for 15–18 years in the wild. In captivity they can live for up to 25 years. [Oestrus] Oestrus typically lasts five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in [the usual felid posture] the usual felid posture , from 12 to 36 times a day. They are unusual among large cats in that they have a well-defined birth peak. They usually [mate] mate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Females have a [gestation period] gestation period of 90–100 days, and the cubs are born between April and June. A [litter] litter usually consists of two to three cubs, in exceptional cases there can be up to seven. 
The female gives birth in a rocky den or crevice lined with fur shed from her underside. The cubs are born blind and helpless, although already with a thick coat of fur, and weigh 320 to 567 g (11.3 to 20.0 oz). Their eyes open at around seven days, and the cubs can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks. The cubs leave the den when they are around two to four months of age. Three radio-collared snow leopards in Mongolia's Tost Mountains gave birth between late April and late June. Two female cubs started to part from their mothers at the age of 20 to 21 months, but reunited with them several times for a few days over a period of 4–7 months. One male cub separated from his mother at the age of about 22 months, but stayed in her vicinity for a month and moved out of his natal range at 23 months of age. 
The snow leopard has a [generation length] generation length of eight years. 
== Threats ==
Major threats to the population include poaching and illegal trade of its skins and body parts. Between 1999 and 2002, three live snow leopard cubs and 16 skins were [confiscated] confiscated , 330 [traps] traps were destroyed and 110 poachers were arrested in Kyrgyzstan. [Undercover operations] Undercover operations in the country revealed an illegal trade network with links to Russia and China via Kazakhstan. The major skin trade center in the region is the city of [Kashgar] Kashgar in [Xinjiang] Xinjiang . In Tibet and Mongolia, skins are used for traditional dresses, and meat in [traditional Tibetan medicine] traditional Tibetan medicine to cure [kidney] kidney problems; bones are used in [traditional Chinese] traditional Chinese and [Mongolian medicine] Mongolian medicine for treating [rheumatism] rheumatism , injuries and pain of human bones and [tendons] tendons . Between 1996 and 2002, 37 skins were found in wildlife markets and tourist shops in Mongolia. Between 2003 and 2016, 710 skins were traded, of which 288 skins were confiscated. In China, an estimated 103 to 236 animals are poached every year, in Mongolia between 34 and 53, in Pakistan between 23 and 53, in India from 21 to 45, and in Tajikistan 20 to 25. In 2016, a survey of Chinese websites revealed 15 advertisements for 44 snow leopard products; the dealers offered skins, canine teeth, claws and a tongue. In September 2014, nine snow leopard skins were found during a market survey in Afghanistan. 
[Greenhouse gas] Greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a shift of the [treeline] treeline in the Himalayas and a shrinking of the [alpine zone] alpine zone , which may reduce snow leopard habitat by an estimated 30%. 
Where snow leopards prey on domestic [livestock] livestock , they are subject to [human–wildlife conflict] human–wildlife conflict . The loss of natural prey due to overgrazing by livestock, poaching, and defense of livestock are the major drivers for the ever decreasing snow leopard population. Livestock also cause habitat degradation, which, alongside the increasing use of forests for fuel, reduces snow leopard habitat. 
== Conservation ==
The snow leopard is listed in [CITES Appendix I] CITES Appendix I . They have been listed as threatened with extinction in Schedule I of the [Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals] Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals since 1985. Hunting snow leopards has been prohibited in Kyrgyzstan since the 1950s. In India, the snow leopard is granted the highest level of protection under the [Wildlife Protection Act, 1972] Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 , and hunting is sentenced with [imprisonment] imprisonment of 3–7 years. In Nepal, they have been legally protected since 1973, with penalties of 5–15 years in prison and a [fine] fine for poaching and trading them. Since 1978, they have been listed in the [Soviet Union] Soviet Union ’s Red Book and is still inscribed today in the [Red Data Book of the Russian Federation] Red Data Book of the Russian Federation as threatened with extinction. Hunting snow leopards is only permitted for the purposes of conservation and monitoring, and to eliminate a threat to the life of humans and livestock. [Smuggling] Smuggling of snow leopard body parts is punished with imprisonment and a [fine] fine . Hunting snow leopards has been prohibited in Afghanistan since 1986. In China, they have been protected by law since 1989; hunting and trading snow leopards or their body parts constitute a [criminal] criminal offence that is punishable by the [confiscation] confiscation of property, a fine and a [sentence] sentence of at least 10 years in prison. They have been protected in Bhutan since 1995. 
At the end of 2020, 35 cameras were installed on the outskirts of Almaty, Kazakhstan in hopes to catch footage of snow leopards. In November 2021, it was announced by the Russian World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that snow leopards were spotted 65 times on these cameras in the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains since the cameras were installed. 
=== Global Snow Leopard Forum ===
In 2013, government leaders and officials from all 12 countries encompassing the snow leopard's range (Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) came together at the Global Snow Leopard Forum (GSLF) initiated by the then-President of Kyrgyzstan [Almazbek Atambayev] Almazbek Atambayev , and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the government of Kyrgyzstan. The meeting was held in [Bishkek] Bishkek , and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow leopard populations, and to safeguard its fragile environment. The event brought together many partners, including [NGOs] NGOs like the [Snow Leopard Conservancy] Snow Leopard Conservancy , the [Snow Leopard Trust] Snow Leopard Trust , and the [Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union] Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union . Also supporting the initiative were the Snow Leopard Network, the [World Bank] World Bank 's [Global Tiger Initiative] Global Tiger Initiative , the [United Nations Development Programme] United Nations Development Programme , the [World Wild Fund for Nature] World Wild Fund for Nature , the [United States Agency for International Development] United States Agency for International Development , and [Global Environment Facility] Global Environment Facility . 
=== In captivity ===
The [Moscow Zoo] Moscow Zoo exhibited the first captive snow leopard in 1872 that had been caught in [Turkestan] Turkestan . In Kyrgyzstan, 420 live snow leopards were caught between 1936 and 1988 and exported to zoos around the world. The [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo housed a live snow leopard in 1903; this was the first ever specimen exhibited in a North American zoo. The first [captive bred] captive bred snow leopard cubs were born in the 1990s in the [Beijing Zoo] Beijing Zoo . The Snow Leopard [Species Survival Plan] Species Survival Plan was initiated in 1984; by 1986, [American zoos] American zoos held 234 individuals. 
== Cultural significance ==
The snow leopard is widely used in [heraldry] heraldry and as an emblem in Central Asia. The Aq Bars [Aq Bars] Aq Bars ('White Leopard') is a political symbol of the [Tatars] Tatars , [Kazakhs] Kazakhs , and [Bulgars] Bulgars . A mythical winged Aq Bars Aq Bars is depicted on the national [coat of arms of Tatarstan] coat of arms of Tatarstan , the seal of the city of [Samarqand] Samarqand , Uzbekistan and the old coat of arms of [Astana] Astana . A snow leopard is depicted on the official seal of [Almaty] Almaty and on the former 10,000 [Kazakhstani tenge] Kazakhstani tenge banknote. In Kyrgyzstan, it is used in highly stylized form in the modern emblem of the capital [Bishkek] Bishkek , and the same art has been integrated into the badge of the [Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association] Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association . It is also considered to be a sacred creature by the [Kyrgyz people] Kyrgyz people . A crowned snow leopard features in the arms of [Shushensky District] Shushensky District in Russia. It is the [state animal] state animal of [Ladakh] Ladakh and [Himachal Pradesh] Himachal Pradesh in India. 
The 1978 book The Snow Leopard [The Snow Leopard] The Snow Leopard is an account by [Peter Matthiessen] Peter Matthiessen about his two-month journey through the [Dolpo] Dolpo region of the Nepal Himalayas in search of the snow leopard.
