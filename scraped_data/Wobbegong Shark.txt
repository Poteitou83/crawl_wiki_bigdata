Title: Wobbegong

Wobbegong Wobbegong is the common name given to the 12 species of [carpet sharks] carpet sharks in the family Orectolobidae Orectolobidae . They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western [Pacific Ocean] Pacific Ocean and eastern [Indian Ocean] Indian Ocean , chiefly around [Australia] Australia and [Indonesia] Indonesia , although one species (the [Japanese wobbegong] Japanese wobbegong , Orectolobus japonicus Orectolobus japonicus ) occurs as far north as [Japan] Japan . The word wobbegong wobbegong is believed to come from an [Australian Aboriginal language] Australian Aboriginal language , meaning "shaggy beard", referring to the growths around the mouth of the shark of the western Pacific.
== Description ==
Wobbegongs are bottom-dwelling sharks, spending much of their time resting on the sea floor. Most species have a maximum length of 1.25 m (4.1 ft), but the largest, the [spotted wobbegong] spotted wobbegong , Orectolobus maculatus Orectolobus maculatus , and [banded wobbegong] banded wobbegong , O. halei O. halei , reach about 3 m (9.8 ft) in length.
Wobbegongs are well [camouflaged] camouflaged with a [symmetrical] symmetrical pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet. Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are often referred to as [carpet sharks] carpet sharks . The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes surrounding the wobbegong's jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. Wobbegongs make use of their camouflage to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of [ambush predators] ambush predators . Wobbegongs also have a powerful jaw with needle-like teeth that assist in catching reef fish and other sharks for food. The blood cells of several species of wobbegong have also been described. 
== Interaction with humans ==
Wobbegongs are generally not considered dangerous to humans, but have attacked swimmers, snorkelers, and scuba divers who inadvertently come close to them. The [Australian Shark Attack File] Australian Shark Attack File contains more than 50 records of unprovoked attacks by wobbegongs, and the [International Shark Attack File] International Shark Attack File 31 records, none of them fatal. Wobbegongs have also bitten [surfers] surfers . Wobbegongs are very flexible and can easily bite a hand holding onto their tail. They have many small but sharp teeth and their bite can be severe, even through a wetsuit; having once bitten, they have been known to hang on and can be very difficult to remove. 
In Australia, wobbegong skin is used to make [leather] leather . 
=== Captivity ===
Although most wobbegong species are unsuitable for home aquaria due to their large adult size, this has not stopped some of the larger species from being sold in the aquarium trade. Small wobbegong species, such as the [tasselled wobbegong] tasselled wobbegong and [Ward's wobbegong] Ward's wobbegong , are "ideal" sharks for home aquarists to [keep] keep because they are an appropriate size and are lethargic, enabling them to be accommodated within the limited space of a home tank, although they will consume tankmates, even quite large ones. Some aquarists, by contrast, see the lack of activity to be a drawback to keeping wobbegongs, and prefer more active sharks. Wobbegongs are largely nocturnal and, due to their slow metabolism, do not have to be fed as often as other sharks. Most do well on two feedings weekly. Underfed wobbegongs can be recognised by visibly atrophied dorsal musculature.
