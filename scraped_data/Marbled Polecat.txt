Title: Marbled polecat


The marbled polecat marbled polecat ( Vormela peregusna Vormela peregusna Vormela peregusna ) is a small mammal belonging to the [genus] genus  Vormela [Vormela] Vormela within the [mustelid] mustelid  [subfamily] subfamily  [Ictonychinae] Ictonychinae . Vormela Vormela is from the [German] German word Würmlein Würmlein Würmlein , which means "little worm". The [specific name] specific name  peregusna peregusna comes from perehuznya perehuznya perehuznya ( перегузня перегузня перегузня ), which is [Ukrainian] Ukrainian for "polecat". Marbled polecats are generally found in the drier areas and [grasslands] grasslands of [southeastern Europe] southeastern Europe to [western China] western China . Like other members of the Ictonychinae, it can emit a strong-smelling secretion from anal sacs under the tail when threatened.
== Description ==
Ranging in length from 29–35 cm (head and body), the marbled polecat has a short muzzle and very large, noticeable ears. The limbs are short and claws are long and strong. While the tail is long, with long hair, the overall [pelage] pelage is short.  Black and white mark the face, with a black stripe across the eyes and white markings around the mouth. [Dorsally] Dorsally , the pelage is yellow and heavily mottled with irregular reddish or brown spots. The tail is dark brown with a yellowish band in the midregion. The [ventral] ventral region and limbs are a dark brown. Females weigh from 295 to 600 g (10.4 to 21.2 oz) and males from 320 to 715 g (11.3 to 25.2 oz). 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The marbled polecat is native from southeastern Europe to [Russia] Russia and [China] China . Its range includes [Ukraine] Ukraine , [Bulgaria] Bulgaria , [Georgia] Georgia , [Turkey] Turkey , [Romania] Romania , [Lebanon] Lebanon , [Syria] Syria , [Jordan] Jordan , [Israel] Israel , [Palestine] Palestine , [Armenia] Armenia , [Azerbaijan] Azerbaijan , [Iraq] Iraq , [Iran] Iran , [Afghanistan] Afghanistan , north-western [Pakistan] Pakistan , [Yugoslavia] Yugoslavia , [Mongolia] Mongolia , China, [Kazakhstan] Kazakhstan , North-Siberian [Altai] Altai  [steppes] steppes . In 1998, a marbled polecat was recorded on the [Sinai Peninsula] Sinai Peninsula , [Egypt] Egypt . Marbled polecats are found in open [desert] desert , semidesert, and [semiarid] semiarid rocky areas in upland [valleys] valleys and low [hill] hill ranges, [steppe] steppe country, and arid subtropical [scrub forest] scrub forest .  They avoid mountainous regions. Marbled polecats have been sighted in cultivated areas such as melon patches and vegetable fields. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The marbled polecat is most active during the morning and evening. Its eyesight is weak, and it relies on its well-developed sense of smell. Vocalization is limited and consists of shrill alarm cries, grunts and a submissive long shriek. It is [solitary] solitary and moves extensively through a [home range] home range of 0.5–0.6 km (0.19–0.23 sq mi). It generally stays in a shelter once. When encountering each other, they are usually aggressive. 
When alarmed, a marbled polecat raises up on its legs while arching its back and curling its tail over its back, with the long tail hair erect. It may also raise its head, bare its teeth, and give shrill, short hisses. If threatened, it can expel a foul-smelling secretion from enlarged anal glands under its tail. 
To excavate burrows, the marbled polecat digs out earth with its forelegs while anchoring itself with its chin and hind legs. It uses its teeth to pull out obstacles such as roots. 
Burrows of large [ground squirrels] ground squirrels or similar rodents such as the [great gerbil] great gerbil ( Rhombomys opimus Rhombomys opimus ) and Libyan [jird] jird ( Meriones libycus Meriones libycus ) are used by marbled polecats for resting and breeding. They may also dig their own dens or live in underground irrigation tunnels. In the winter, marbled polecats line their dens with grass. 
=== Reproduction ===
Marbled polecats mate from March to early June. Their mating calls are most often heard as low, rumbling sounds in a slow rhythm. [Gestation] Gestation can be long and variable (243 to 327 days). [Parturition] Parturition has been observed to occur from late January to mid-March.  [Delayed implantation] Delayed implantation allows marbled polecats to time the birth of their cubs for favorable conditions, such as when prey is abundant. 
Litter sizes range from four to eight cubs. Only females care for the young. Cubs open their eyes  around 38–40 days old, are [weaned] weaned at 50–54 days, and leave their mother (disperse) at 61–68 days old. 
=== Diet ===
Marbled polecats are known to eat [ground squirrels] ground squirrels , [Libyan jirds] Libyan jirds ( Meriones libycus Meriones libycus ), Armenian hamsters ( Cricetulus migratorius [Cricetulus migratorius] Cricetulus migratorius ), [voles] voles , [Palestine mole-rats] Palestine mole-rats ( Spalax lecocon ehrenbergi Spalax lecocon ehrenbergi ), [house mice] house mice ( Mus musculus Mus musculus ), and other rodents, small [hares] hares , [birds] birds , [lizards] lizards , [fish] fish , [frogs] frogs , [snails] snails , and [insects] insects ( [beetles] beetles and [crickets] crickets ), as well as fruit and grass. They are also recorded as taking small domestic poultry such as [chickens] chickens and [pigeons] pigeons , as well as stealing smoked meat and cheese. 
== Conservation status ==
In 2008, the marbled polecat was classified as a [vulnerable species] vulnerable species in the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List due to a population reduction of at least 30% in the previous 10 years. In 1996, it had been considered a species of [least concern] least concern . The decline in marbled polecat populations thought to be due to [habitat loss] habitat loss and reduction in available prey due to use of [rodenticides] rodenticides . 
Data revealed that from the west to the east, a gradual decrease in morphological diversity was seen in polecat skulls, thus giving location as a factor to diversify the polecats. Also, the data related to the range formation of the species rather than [climate change] climate change . 
== Threats ==
The marbled polecat was once sought for its fur, generally known as "fitch" or more specifically, "perwitsky" in the fur trade.
