Title: Vampire ground finch


Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis 
The vampire ground finch vampire ground finch ( Geospiza septentrionalis Geospiza septentrionalis Geospiza septentrionalis ) is a small [bird] bird native to the [Gal치pagos Islands] Gal치pagos Islands . [Endemic] Endemic to [Wolf] Wolf and [Darwin Island] Darwin Island , it was previously considered a very distinct [subspecies] subspecies of the [sharp-beaked ground finch] sharp-beaked ground finch ( Geospiza difficilis Geospiza difficilis ), but the [International Ornithologists' Union] International Ornithologists' Union has split the species based on strong genetic evidence that they are not closely related, and divergences in morphology and song. 
== Description ==
The vampire finch is [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic as typical for its [genus] genus , with the males being primarily black and the females grey with brown streaks. It has a lilting song on Wolf, a buzzing song on Darwin, and whistling calls on both islands; only on Wolf, a drawn-out, buzzing call is also uttered. 
== Ecology ==
This bird is most famous for its unusual diet. When alternative sources are scarce, the vampire finch occasionally feeds
by [drinking the blood] drinking the blood of other birds, chiefly the [Nazca] Nazca and [blue-footed boobies] blue-footed boobies , pecking at their skin with their sharp beaks until blood is drawn. Curiously, the boobies do not offer much resistance against this. It has been theorized that this behavior evolved from the pecking behavior that the finch used to clean [parasites] parasites from the plumage of the booby. The finches also feed on eggs, stealing them just after they are laid and rolling them (by pushing with their legs and using their beak as a pivot) into rocks until they break. Finally guano and leftover fish from other predators additionally serve as diet options. 
Vampire ground finches drink more blood during dry seasons when seeds and other prey are scarce, resuming omnivorous predation when the rainy season begins. There were also significant variations in the intestinal microbial community structure. There was a clear separation between vampire ground finches and other finches. Vampire ground finch birds have [intestinal microbial communities] intestinal microbial communities rich in [peptostreptococcacea] peptostreptococcacea . Similarly, [vampire bats] vampire bats also possess [peptostreptococcacea] peptostreptococcacea in their gut flora. 
More conventionally for birds, but still unusual among Geospiza, Geospiza, they also take [nectar] nectar from [Gal치pagos prickly pear] Gal치pagos prickly pear ( Opuntia echios Opuntia echios var. gigantea gigantea ) flowers, at least on Wolf Island. The reason for these peculiar feeding habits is the lack of [fresh water] fresh water on these birds' home islands. Nonetheless, the mainstay of their diet is made up from seeds and [invertebrates] invertebrates , as in their congeners. 
== Conservation ==
The vampire finch is classified as [vulnerable] vulnerable by the [IUCN] IUCN based on its very restricted distribution and the impact of invasive species in its habitat.
