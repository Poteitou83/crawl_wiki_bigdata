Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis is a genus of [pelagic] pelagic  [cirrate (finned) octopods] cirrate (finned) octopods known as the dumbo octopuses dumbo octopuses . The name "dumbo" originates from their resemblance to the title character of [Disney] Disney 's 1941 film Dumbo [Dumbo] Dumbo , having two prominent ear-like fins which extend from the [mantle] mantle above each eye. There are 17 species recognized in the genus. 
Prey include [crustaceans] crustaceans , [bivalves] bivalves , worms and [copepods] copepods . The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years. 
== Range and habitat ==
Species of Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis are assumed to have a worldwide distribution, living in the cold, [abyssal] abyssal depths ranging from 1,000–7,000 metres (3,300–23,000 ft). Specimens have been found off the coasts of [Oregon] Oregon , the [Philippines] Philippines , [Martha's Vineyard] Martha's Vineyard , the [Azores] Azores , [New Zealand] New Zealand , [Australia] Australia , [California] California , [Papua] Papua and [New Guinea] New Guinea , and in the [Gulf of Mexico] Gulf of Mexico . 
A fairly recent observation was on 21 June 2022 at 1,250 metres (4,100 ft) by the vessel Normand Ocean Normand Ocean , which inspects [drilling platforms] drilling platforms with underwater drones; the vessel was examining chains and risers on the Aasta Hansteen platform outside [Trøndelag] Trøndelag , [Norway] Norway . The most recent observation as of 2023 was on 24 May 2023 at 2 108 108 meters, meters, this time in [Guyana] Guyana by the vessel Far Samson [Far Samson] Far Samson , which also uses underwater drones. 
Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living octopuses known, with some specimens captured or observed at [hadal] hadal depths. One Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis specimen was captured 60 kilometres (37 mi) southeast of [Grand Cayman] Grand Cayman at 7,279 metres (23,881 ft), but this depth is uncertain (as the specimen may have been captured while the net was descending to this depth). 
However, in 2020, Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis was spotted 6,957 metres (22,825 ft) deep in the [Java Trench] Java Trench , confirming the [hadal] hadal distribution of this genus. 
== Species and taxonomy ==
As noted below, many species collected on the [Challengerexpedition] Challenger Challenger expedition were initially classified in the genera Cirroteuthis [Cirroteuthis] Cirroteuthis and [Stauroteuthis] Stauroteuthis . Several species formerly classified as Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis were moved to genera Cirroctopus [Cirroctopus] Cirroctopus and Opisthoteuthis [Opisthoteuthis] Opisthoteuthis . A new family, Grimpoteuthididae (alternatively spelled [Grimpoteuthidae] Grimpoteuthidae ), has been proposed to accommodate Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis and those of genera Enigmatiteuthis Enigmatiteuthis , Cryptoteuthis [Cryptoteuthis] Cryptoteuthis , and Luteuthis [Luteuthis] Luteuthis . The persistent confusion and disparity about the taxonomy of these species has been attributed to the poor quality and limited number of specimens available for study. 
== Movement, characteristics, and food supply ==
Observations of animals in the Atlantic reveal that Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis often rest on the seafloor with the arms and web spread out and uses its arms to slowly crawl along the seafloor. When disturbed the webbing and arms are contracted to push the animal off the seafloor with it then transitioning to movement using the mantle fins for rapid locomotion. The cushiony cartilage that can be found in the proximal position of the fin of the octopus is responsible for acting as a support for the thick muscles that are attached, these muscles are what allow for rapid locomotion.
Although it has been suggested that species of Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis are capable of [jet-propulsion] jet-propulsion (while swimming using the fins), this has since been deemed unlikely. 
Feeding behavior has not been directly observed in Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis , but presumably is similar to Opisthoteuthis [Opisthoteuthis] Opisthoteuthis that trap small prey items in the webbing (either by enclosing the prey in the arm webbing or between the webbing and the seafloor) and then use the cirri (fingerlike projections along the arms) to move food to the mouth. Known prey items (from dissected animals) include benthic [polychaetes] polychaetes , [benthopelagic] benthopelagic  [copepods] copepods , [amphipods] amphipods and [isopods] isopods . 
== Breeding ==
The cirrate octopuses are classified as 'continuous spawners': Females carry multiple eggs in various stages of maturation, and only lay one or two eggs at a time, with no seasonality in spawning (however, most of these aspects of reproductive biology have only been confirmed in Opisthoteuthis Opisthoteuthis , not Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis ). Mating in cirrate octopuses has never been observed, and unlike other octopuses, members of Cirrata lack a [hectocotylus] hectocotylus for the transfer of sperm packets. Cirrate octopus eggs are large and have a tough casing surrounding the [chorion] chorion (not found in other octopuses), and Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis in particular attach their eggs to deep sea corals ( [octocorals] octocorals ). The female cirrate octopus does not guard or incubate the eggs (again unlike other octopuses).  Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis hatchlings emerge as "fully competent" juveniles with all of the sensory and motor features to survive on their own. 
[Sexual dimorphism] Sexual dimorphism between males and females is less noticeable and consistent in Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis compared to other cirrate octopuses (such as Opisthoteuthis Opisthoteuthis ). In some species (e.g., G. bathynectes G. bathynectes and G.. discoveryi G.. discoveryi ), the males have enlarged suckers relative to the females, but no such enlargement is found in other Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis species. 
== Threats ==
Species of Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis face few direct threats from humans, living at depths of 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) and below. Natural predators of cirrate octopuses include large [teleost] teleost fish and sharks, and even marine mammals such as sperm whales and seals, but these are mostly predators of other cirrate genera, and Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis has only been recorded in the stomach contents of a shark. 
The Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis do not have an ink sac (as is the case with all cirrate octopuses). Furthermore, the cirrate octopuses lack innervated chromatophores and are therefore not capable of changing color (despite some unreferenced statements to the contrary). How cirrate octopuses escape or avoid predators is largely unknown.
