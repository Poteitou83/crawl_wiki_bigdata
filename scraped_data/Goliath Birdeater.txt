Title: Goliath birdeater


The Goliath birdeater Goliath birdeater ( Theraphosa blondi Theraphosa blondi Theraphosa blondi ) belongs to the [tarantula] tarantula family [Theraphosidae] Theraphosidae . Found in northern [South America] South America , it is the largest [spider] spider in the world by mass (175 g (6.2 oz)) and body length (up to 13 cm (5.1 in)), and second to the [giant huntsman spider] giant huntsman spider by leg span. It is also called the Goliath tarantula Goliath tarantula or Goliath bird-eating spider Goliath bird-eating spider ; the practice of calling theraphosids "bird-eating" derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by [Maria Sibylla Merian] Maria Sibylla Merian that shows one [eating a hummingbird] eating a hummingbird . Despite the spider's name, it rarely preys on birds. 
== Characteristics ==
These spiders can have a leg span of up to 30 cm (12 in), a body length of up to 13 cm (5.1 in), and can weigh up to 175 g (6.2 oz). Birdeaters are one of the few tarantula species that lack tibial spurs, located on the first pair of legs of most adult males. They are mostly tan to light brown and golden-hued. 
== Life cycle ==
Unlike other species of spider/tarantula, females rarely [eat the males during mating] eat the males during mating . Females mature in 3–6 years and have an average lifespan of 15 to 25 years. Males die soon after maturity and have a lifespan of three to six years. Colors range from dark to light brown with faint markings on the legs. Bird-eaters have hair on their bodies, abdomens, and legs. The female lays 100 to 200 eggs, which hatch into spiderlings within 6–8 weeks. 
== Behaviour ==
=== Defenses ===
In response to threats, Goliath birdeaters [stridulate] stridulate by rubbing [setae] setae on their [pedipalps] pedipalps and legs. Also, when threatened they rub their abdomen with their hind legs and release hairs that are a severe irritant to the skin and [mucous membranes] mucous membranes . These [urticating hairs] urticating hairs can be harmful to humans. 
Like all tarantulas, T. blondi T. blondi spiders have [fangs] fangs large enough (2–4 cm or 0.79–1.57 in) to break the skin of a human. They carry [venom] venom in their fangs and have been known to bite when threatened, but the venom is relatively harmless and its effects are comparable to those of a [wasp] wasp 's sting. Tarantulas generally bite humans only in self-defense, and these bites do not always result in [envenomation] envenomation (known as a " [dry bite] dry bite ”). 
=== Feeding ===
Despite its name,  the Goliath birdeater only rarely actually preys on birds; in the wild, its diet consists primarily of other large [arthropods] arthropods , [worms] worms , and [amphibians] amphibians . However, because of its size and opportunistic predatory behavior,  this species commonly kills and consumes a variety of [insects] insects and small terrestrial [vertebrates] vertebrates . They do not consume their prey in the open; rather, they drag it back to their burrow and begin the digesting process. They do this by liquefying the insides of their prey and proceed to suck it dry. In the wild, T. blondi T. blondi has been observed feeding on [rodents] rodents , [frogs] frogs , [toads] toads , [lizards] lizards , and even [snakes] snakes . 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Goliath birdeater is native to the upland [rainforest] rainforest regions of [Northern South America] Northern South America : [Suriname] Suriname , [Guyana] Guyana , [French Guiana] French Guiana , northern [Brazil] Brazil ,  eastern [Colombia] Colombia , and southern [Venezuela] Venezuela . Most noticeable in the [Amazon rainforest] Amazon rainforest , the spider is terrestrial, living in deep burrows, and is found commonly in [marshy] marshy or [swampy] swampy areas. It is a nocturnal species. 
== Culinary use ==
The Goliath birdeater is an [edible spider] edible spider . The spider is part of the local cuisine in northeastern South America, prepared by singeing off the [urticating hairs] urticating hairs and roasting it in banana leaves. The flavor has been described as "shrimp-like".
