Title: Sunbittern


The sunbittern sunbittern ( Eurypyga helias Eurypyga helias Eurypyga helias ) is a [bittern] bittern -like bird of tropical regions of the Americas, and the [sole member] sole member of the [family] family  Eurypygidae Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae Eurypigidae ) and [genus] genus  Eurypyga Eurypyga Eurypyga . It is found in Central and South America, and has three [subspecies] subspecies . The sunbittern shows both morphological and molecular similarities with the [kagu] kagu ( Rhynochetos jubatus Rhynochetos jubatus ) of [New Caledonia] New Caledonia , indicating a [Gondwanan] Gondwanan origin, both species being placed in the [clade] clade  [Eurypygiformes] Eurypygiformes . 
== Taxonomy ==
The sunbittern was traditionally placed in the [Gruiformes] Gruiformes , but this was always considered preliminary. Altogether, the bird is most similar to another bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the [kagu] kagu ( Rhynochetos jubatus Rhynochetos jubatus ). Molecular studies seem to confirm that the kagu and sunbittern are each other's closest living relatives and have a similar wing display. They are probably not Gruiformes (though the proposed [Metaves] Metaves are just as weakly supported). Altogether, the two species seem to form a minor [Gondwanan] Gondwanan lineage which could also include the extinct [adzebills] adzebills and/or the [mesites] mesites , and is of unclear relation to the Gruiformes proper. Notably, the kagu and mesites also have [powder down] powder down .
An indeterminate fossil eurypygid has been documented from the [Green River Formation] Green River Formation of [Wyoming] Wyoming , USA. This specimen, known from a full skeleton, is the oldest and only known fossil of the group, and suggests that eurypygids had a much more northernly range in the past. This specimen has been figured in several studies, and was given the unofficial name " Eoeurypyga olsoni Eoeurypyga olsoni " in a 2003 dissertation, but as-of-yet remains unnamed. 
=== Subspecies ===
The sunbittern was formerly treated as two species ( E. helias E. helias and E. major E. major ), but now they are treated as a single species with considerable variation between the [subspecies] subspecies . The three subspecies are recognised on the basis of plumage characters and size. The three subspecies are [allopatric] allopatric . 
== Description ==
The bird has a generally subdued coloration, with fine linear patterns of black, grey and brown. Its [remiges] remiges however have vividly colored middle webs, which with wings fully spread show bright eyespots in red, yellow, and black. These are shown to other sunbitterns in courtship and threat displays, or used to startle potential predators. Male and female adult sunbitterns can be differentiated by small differences in the feather patterns of the throat and head. Like some other birds, the sunbittern has [powder down] powder down .
The sunbittern has a long and pointed bill that is black above, and a short [hallux] hallux as in shorebirds and rails. In the South American subspecies found in lowlands east of the [Andes] Andes , the upperparts are mainly brown, and the legs and lower mandible are orange-yellow. The two other subspecies are greyer above, and their legs and bill are sometimes redder. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The sunbittern's [range] range extends from [Guatemala] Guatemala to [Brazil] Brazil . The nominate race, E. h. helias E. h. helias , is found east of the Andes in lowland tropical South America, from the [Orinoco] Orinoco basin, through the [Amazon basin] Amazon basin and [Pantanal] Pantanal . The subspecies E. h. meridionalis E. h. meridionalis , has a more restricted distribution, being found along the East Andean slope in south-central [Peru] Peru , in the lower subtropical zone at altitudes of 800–1,830 m (2,620–6,000 ft). The final subspecies, E. h. major E. h. major , is found at various altitudes ranging from southern [Guatemala] Guatemala , through Central America and the [Chocó] Chocó to western [Ecuador] Ecuador . This subspecies may also be present in southern [Mexico] Mexico . It has been traditionally reported from the Atlantic slope of [Chiapas] Chiapas , but no specimens are known and there have been no recent records. 
The species is found in the humid [Neotropical] Neotropical forests, generally with an open understorey and near rivers, streams, ponds or lagoons. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
They are cryptic birds that display their large wings, that exhibits a pattern that resemble eyes, when they feel threatened.
=== Feeding ===
The sunbittern consumes a wide range of animal prey. Insects form an important part of the diet, with cockroaches, dragonfly larvae, flies, katydids, water beetles and moths being taken. Other invertebrate prey includes crabs, spiders, shrimps and earthworms. They will also take vertebrate prey including fish, tadpoles, toads and frogs, eels and lizards. 
Sunbitterns are one of 12 species of birds in five families that have been described as fishing using baits or lures to attract prey to within striking distance. This type of behaviour falls within the common definition of [tool use] tool use . In sunbitterns this behaviour has only been observed in captive birds so far. 
=== Breeding ===
Sunbitterns start nesting in the early wet season and before it starts they make flight displays 10–15 m (33–49 ft) high in the forest canopy. They build open nests in trees, and lay two eggs with blotched markings. The young are [precocial] precocial , but remain in the nest for several weeks after hatching.
