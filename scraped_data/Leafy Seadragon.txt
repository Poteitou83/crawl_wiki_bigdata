Title: Leafy seadragon


The leafy seadragon leafy seadragon ( Phycodurus eques Phycodurus eques ) or Glauert's seadragon Glauert's seadragon , is a marine [fish] fish . It is the [only member] only member of the genus Phycodurus Phycodurus Phycodurus in the family [Syngnathidae] Syngnathidae , which includes [seadragons] seadragons , [pipefish] pipefish , and [seahorses] seahorses . 
It is found along the southern and western coasts of [Australia] Australia . The name is derived from their appearance, with long leaf-like protrusions coming from all over the body. These protrusions are not used for propulsion; they serve only as [camouflage] camouflage . The leafy seadragon propels itself utilising a pair of [pectoral fins] pectoral fins on the sides of its neck and a [dorsal fin] dorsal fin on its back closer to the tail end. These small fins are almost completely transparent and difficult to see as they [undulate] undulate minutely to move the creature sedately through the water, completing the illusion of floating [seaweed] seaweed .
Popularly known as "leafies", they are the [marine emblem] marine emblem of the state of [South Australia] South Australia and a focus for local marine conservation. 
== Taxonomy ==
The generic name is derived from the Greek words φῦκος φῦκος φῦκος  phûkos phûkos "seaweed" and δέρμα δέρμα δέρμα  derma derma "skin". 
== Description ==
Much like the [seahorse] seahorse , the leafy seadragon's name is derived from its resemblance to another creature (in this case, the mythical [dragon] dragon ). While not large, they are slightly larger than most seahorses, growing to about 20–24 cm (8–9.5 in). They feed on [plankton] plankton and small [crustaceans] crustaceans .
The lobes of skin that grow on the leafy seadragon provide [camouflage] camouflage , giving it the appearance of seaweed. It is able to maintain the illusion when swimming, appearing to move through the water like a piece of floating seaweed. It can also change colour to blend in, but this ability depends on the seadragon's diet, age, location, and stress level.
The leafy seadragon is related to the [pipefish] pipefish and belongs to the family [Syngnathidae] Syngnathidae , along with the seahorse. It differs from the seahorse in appearance, form of locomotion, and its inability to coil or grasp things with its tail. A related species is the [weedy seadragon] weedy seadragon , which is multicoloured and grows weed-like fins, but is smaller than the leafy seadragon. Another unique feature is the small, circular gill openings covering tufted gills, very unlike the crescent-shaped gill openings and ridged gills of most fish species. 
== Habitat and distribution ==
The leafy seadragon is found only in southern Australian waters, from [Wilson’s Promontory] Wilson’s Promontory in [Victoria] Victoria at the eastern end of its range, westward to [Jurien Bay] Jurien Bay ,  220 km (140 mi) north of [Perth] Perth in [Western Australia] Western Australia . Individuals were once thought to have very restricted ranges; but further research has discovered that seadragons actually travel several hundred metres from their habitual locations, returning to the same spot using a strong sense of direction. They are mostly found over sand patches in waters up to 50 m (160 ft) deep, around kelp-covered rocks and clumps of sea grass. They are commonly sighted by scuba divers near [Adelaide] Adelaide in South Australia, especially at [Rapid Bay] Rapid Bay , [Edithburgh] Edithburgh , and [Victor Harbor] Victor Harbor . 
== Ecology ==
Leafy seadragons usually live a solitary lifestyle. When the time comes, males court the females, they then pair up to breed. From the moment they hatch, leafy seadragons are completely independent. By the age of two, they are typically full grown and ready to breed. 
The species feeds by sucking up small crustaceans, such as [amphipods] amphipods and [mysid shrimp] mysid shrimp , [plankton] plankton , and [larval fish] larval fish through its long, pipe-like snout. 
=== Reproduction ===
As with seahorses, the male leafy seadragon cares for the [eggs] eggs . The female produces up to 250 bright pink eggs, then deposits them onto the male's tail with her [ovipositor] ovipositor , a long tube. The eggs then attach themselves to a brood patch, which supplies them with oxygen. After 9 weeks, the eggs begin to hatch, depending on water conditions. The eggs turn a ripe purple or orange over this period, after which the male pumps his tail until the young emerge, a process which takes place over 24–48 hours. The male aids the hatching of the eggs by shaking his tail, and rubbing it against seaweed and rocks. Once born, the young seadragon is completely independent, eating small [zooplankton] zooplankton until large enough to hunt [mysids] mysids . Only about 5% of the eggs survive. Each newborn fry begins life with a small, externally-attached yolk-sac. This sac provides them sustenance for their first few days of life. Despite this initial nutrition source, the majority of fry will instinctively learn to hunt and catch prey upon hatching, and will become self-reliant before the sac is gone. 
=== Movement ===
The leafy seadragon uses the fins along the side of its head to allow it to steer and turn. However, its outer skin is fairly rigid, limiting mobility. Individual leafy seadragons have been observed remaining in one location for extended periods of time (up to 68 hours), but will sometimes move for lengthy periods. The tracking of one individual indicated it moved at up to 150 m (490 ft) per hour. 
== Conservation ==
Leafy seadragons are subject to many threats, both natural and man-made. They are caught by collectors, and used in [alternative medicine] alternative medicine . They are vulnerable when first born, and are slow swimmers, reducing their chance of escaping from a predator. Seadragons are sometimes washed ashore after storms. 
The species has become endangered through [pollution] pollution and industrial runoff, as well as collection for the aquarium trade. In response to these dangers, the species has been totally protected in [South Australia] South Australia since 1987, [Victoria] Victoria since at least 1995, and [Western Australia] Western Australia since 1991. Additionally, the species' listing in the [Australian government] Australian government 's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999] Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 means that the welfare of the species has to be considered as a part of any developmental project. 
== In captivity ==
Due to being protected by law, obtaining seadragons is often an expensive and difficult process as they must be from [captive bred] captive bred stock, and exporters must prove their [broodstock] broodstock were caught before collecting restrictions went into effect, or that they had a license to collect seadragons. Seadragons have a specific level of protection under federal [fisheries] fisheries legislation as well as in most Australian states where they occur. Seadragons are difficult to maintain in aquaria. Success in keeping them has been largely confined to the public aquarium sector, due to funding and knowledge that would not be available to the average enthusiast. Attempts to breed the leafy seadragon in [captivity] captivity have so far been unsuccessful.
