Title: Attacus atlas


Attacus atlas Attacus atlas Attacus atlas , the Atlas moth Atlas moth , is a large [saturniid] saturniid  [moth] moth endemic to the forests of Asia. The [species] species was described by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 [10th edition ofSystema Naturae] 10th edition of Systema Naturae Systema Naturae .
The Atlas moth is one of the largest [lepidopterans] lepidopterans , with a wingspan measuring up to 24 cm (9.4 in) and a wing surface area of about 160 cm (≈25 in ). It is only surpassed in wingspan by the [white witch] white witch ( Thysania agrippina Thysania agrippina ) and Attacus caesar [Attacus caesar] Attacus caesar , and in wing surface area by the [Hercules moth] Hercules moth ( Coscinocera hercules Coscinocera hercules ). As in most [silk moths] silk moths , females are noticeably larger and heavier than males, while males have broader [antennae] antennae . 
== Description ==
=== Eggs ===
Atlas moths lay a number of spherical [eggs] eggs , 2.5 mm (0.098 in) in diameter, on the undersides of the leaves of food plants.
=== Larva ===
After approximately two weeks, dusty-green [caterpillars] caterpillars hatch and feed on their egg-shell, and then the foliage of [citrus] citrus , [cinnamon] cinnamon , [guava] guava , and [evergreen] evergreen trees. The caterpillars can grow to 11.5 cm (4.5 in) in length and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) in thickness. They have white, waxy, fleshy spines along their backs, which become more prominent at later [instars] instars . On the last abdominal segment beside the [prolegs] prolegs , there is a large green spot surrounded by an orange ring. 
=== Pupa ===
After reaching a length of about 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the caterpillars [pupate] pupate . They spin a 7–8 cm long papery [cocoon] cocoon interwoven with desiccated leaves and attach it to a twig using a strand of silk. The adult moths emerge from the cocoon after approximately four weeks depending on environmental factors.
=== Imago ===
Adult Atlas moths are weak, unsteady fliers. To conserve energy, the moths rest during the day and fly at night. As they lack fully formed [mouthparts] mouthparts , the adults cannot eat, subsisting entirely on fat reserves accumulated during the larval stage. As a result, they live for only a few days during which their sole objective is seeking out a mate. Adults may be found on wing throughout the year but are most abundant between November and January.
Females release [pheromones] pheromones through a gland on the end of the [abdomen] abdomen to attract a mate. Females stay near discarded [cocoons] cocoons , seeking out a perch where the air currents will best carry their pheromones. Males can detect and [home in] home in on these pheromones from several kilometers away using [chemoreceptors] chemoreceptors located on their feathery [antennae] antennae . 
The body is small compared to the wings. The upper side of the wings is reddish brown with a pattern of black, white, pink, and purple lines. There are triangular, scale-less windows bordered in black on each of the four wings. The undersides of the wings are paler. The tips of both forewings have prominent extensions that resemble the head of a snake. The resemblance is exaggerated by movements of the wings when the moth is confronted by potential predators.
The Atlas moth has a very short, vestigial proboscis, and they do not eat once they have emerged from the cocoon, relying on fat storage for energy. Every flight takes valuable energy and can take days off their already short lives, as it has a very short life span of only one to two weeks. They conserve energy by flying as little as possible. A female will wait for a male to come along and be fertilised, lay eggs and die.
== Habitat ==
Their [habitat] habitat is primarily dry [tropical forests] tropical forests , [secondary forests] secondary forests , and [shrublands] shrublands across [South Asia] South Asia , [East Asia] East Asia , and [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia , including [Borneo] Borneo . 
== Etymology ==
Atlas moths are named after [Atlas] Atlas , the Titan of [Greek mythology] Greek mythology (due to their size). In [Hong Kong] Hong Kong , the [Cantonese] Cantonese means "snake's head moth", referring to the prominent extension of the forewing that resembles the head of a [snake] snake . 
== Relationship with humans ==
In [India] India , Atlas moths are cultivated for their [silk] silk in a non-commercial capacity. Unlike silk produced by the related [domestic silkmoth] domestic silkmoth ( Bombyx mori Bombyx mori ), Atlas moth silk is secreted as broken strands and is therefore less desirable. This brown, wool-like silk, known as fagara fagara , is thought to have greater durability. Atlas moth [cocoons] cocoons are sometimes used as small pocket change purses in [Taiwan] Taiwan . There is ongoing research as to whether the silk of the Atlas moth can be used as a substitute for common silks. The quality of the heavier cocoons, less restrictive rearing conditions, and competent properties of the fibers, make the silk produced by the Atlas moth a potential alternative for common silks. A study concluded that the silk fibers of the atlas moth had about an 80% higher density of cells and growth compared to the silk fibers of the silk moth.

The term "Atlas moth" is sometimes used mistakenly as a name for any species in the genus Attacus [Attacus] Attacus , of which there are over 20 named species and subspecies. Attacus taprobanis [Attacus taprobanis] Attacus taprobanis native to [southern India] southern India and [Sri Lanka] Sri Lanka is very similar in morphology to the much more widely distributed Attacus atlas Attacus atlas . It was once considered a subspecies of A. atlas A. atlas . A few [New World] New World species can be mistaken for Atlas moths, specifically members of the genus Rothschildia [Rothschildia] Rothschildia . Very similar in appearance to the Asian Atlas moth, Rothschildia aurota [Rothschildia aurota] Rothschildia aurota is one of the largest members of its genus and a [Neotropical] Neotropical relative.
