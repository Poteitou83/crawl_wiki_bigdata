Axolotl,Axolotl,"

The axolotl axolotl ( [/ˈæksəlɒtəl/] / ˈ ˈ æ æ k k s s ə ə l l ɒ ɒ t t əl əl /  [] ; from [Classical Nahuatl] Classical Nahuatl : āxōlōtl āxōlōtl  [aːˈʃoːloːtɬ] [[aːˈʃoːloːtɬ]] [aːˈʃoːloːtɬ]  [] ) ( Ambystoma mexicanum Ambystoma mexicanum Ambystoma mexicanum ) is a [paedomorphic] paedomorphic  [salamander] salamander closely related to the [tiger salamander] tiger salamander . It is unusual among [amphibians] amphibians in that it reaches adulthood without undergoing [metamorphosis] metamorphosis . Instead of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and [gilled] gilled . The species was originally found in several lakes underlying what is now [Mexico City] Mexico City , such as [Lake Xochimilco] Lake Xochimilco and [Lake Chalco] Lake Chalco . These lakes were drained by Spanish settlers after the [conquest of the Aztec Empire] conquest of the Aztec Empire , leading to the destruction of much of the axolotl's natural habitat.
As of 2020 , the axolotl was near [extinction] extinction due to urbanization in Mexico City and consequent [water pollution] water pollution , as well as the introduction of invasive species such as [tilapia] tilapia and [perch] perch . It is listed as [critically endangered] critically endangered in the wild, with a decreasing population of around 50 to 1,000 adult individuals, by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources] International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and is listed under Appendix II of the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Axolotls are used extensively in scientific research due to their ability to [regenerate] regenerate limbs, gills and parts of their eyes and brains. Notably, their ability to regenerate declines with age, but it does not disappear. Axolotls keep modestly growing throughout their life and some consider this trait to be a direct contributor to their regenerative abilities. Further research has been conducted to examine their heart as a model of human single ventricle and excessive trabeculation. Axolotls were also sold as food in Mexican markets and were a staple in the [Aztec] Aztec diet. 
Axolotls may be confused with the larval stage of the closely related tiger salamander ( A. tigrinum A. tigrinum ), which are widespread in much of North America and occasionally become paedomorphic, or with [mudpuppies] mudpuppies ( Necturus Necturus spp.), fully aquatic salamanders from a different family that are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance. 
== Description ==
A sexually mature adult axolotl, at age 18–27 months, ranges in length from 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in), although a size close to 23 cm (9 in) is most common and greater than 30 cm (12 in) is rare. Axolotls possess features typical of salamander larvae, including [external gills] external gills and a caudal fin extending from behind the head to the vent. External gills are usually lost when salamander species mature into adulthood, although the axolotl maintains this feature. This is due to their neoteny evolution, where axolotls are much more aquatic than other salamander species. 
Their heads are wide, and their eyes are lidless. Their limbs are underdeveloped and possess long, thin digits. Males are identified by their swollen [cloacae] cloacae lined with papillae, while females are noticeable for their wider bodies full of eggs. Three pairs of [external gill stalks (rami)] external gill stalks (rami) originate behind their heads and are used to move oxygenated water. The external gill rami are lined with filaments (fimbriae) to increase surface area for gas exchange. Four-gill slits lined with [gill rakers] gill rakers are hidden underneath the external gills, which prevent food from entering and allow particles to filter through.
Axolotls have barely visible [vestigial] vestigial teeth, which develop during metamorphosis. The primary method of feeding is by [suction] suction , during which their rakers interlock to close the gill slits. External gills are used for respiration, although [buccal pumping] buccal pumping (gulping air from the surface) may also be used to provide oxygen to their lungs. Buccal pumping can occur in a two-stroke manner that pumps air from the mouth to the lungs, and with four-stroke that reverses this pathway with compression forces.
Axolotls have four pigmentation genes; when mutated, they create different color variants. The normal wild-type animal is brown or tan with gold speckles and an olive undertone. The five most common mutant colors are listed below.
In addition, there is wide individual variability in the size, frequency, and intensity of the gold speckling, and at least one variant develops a black and white piebald appearance upon reaching maturity. Because pet breeders frequently cross the variant colors, double homozygous mutants are common in the pet trade, especially white/pink animals with pink eyes that are double homozygous mutants for both the albino and leucistic trait. Axolotls also have some limited ability to alter their color to provide better camouflage by changing the relative size and thickness of their melanophores. 
== Habitat and ecology ==
The axolotl is native only to the freshwater of [Lake Xochimilco] Lake Xochimilco and [Lake Chalco] Lake Chalco in the [Valley of Mexico] Valley of Mexico . Lake Chalco no longer exists, having been drained as a flood control measure, and Lake Xochimilco remains a remnant of its former self, existing mainly as canals. The water temperature in Xochimilco rarely rises above 20 °C (68 °F), although it may fall to 6–7 °C (43–45 °F) in the winter, and perhaps lower. 
Surveys in 1998, 2003, and 2008 found 6,000, 1,000, and 100 axolotls per square kilometer in its Lake Xochimilco habitat, respectively. A four-month-long search in 2013, however, turned up no surviving individuals in the wild. Just a month later, two wild ones were spotted in a network of canals leading from Xochimilco. 
The wild population has been put under heavy pressure by the growth of [Mexico City] Mexico City . The axolotl is currently on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's annual Red List of threatened species. Non-native fish, such as [African tilapia] African tilapia and [Asian carp] Asian carp , have also recently been introduced to the waters. These new fish have been eating the axolotls' young, as well as their primary source of food. 
Axolotls are members of the tiger salamander, or Ambystoma tigrinum [Ambystoma tigrinum] Ambystoma tigrinum , [species complex] species complex , along with all other Mexican species of Ambystoma Ambystoma . Their habitat is like that of most neotenic species—a high-altitude body of water surrounded by a risky terrestrial environment. These conditions are thought to favor [neoteny] neoteny . However, a terrestrial population of Mexican tiger salamanders occupies and breeds in the axolotl's habitat. 
=== Diet ===
The axolotl is carnivorous, consuming small prey such as mollusks, worms, insects, other arthropods, and small fish in the wild. Axolotls locate food by smell, and will ""snap"" at any potential meal, sucking the food into their stomachs with vacuum force. 
== Use as a model organism ==
Today, the axolotl is still used in research as a [model organism] model organism , and large numbers are bred in captivity. They are especially easy to breed compared to other salamanders in their family, which are rarely captive-bred due to the demands of terrestrial life. One attractive feature for research is the large and easily manipulated [embryo] embryo , which allows viewing of the full development of a vertebrate. Axolotls are used in [heart defect] heart defect studies due to the presence of a mutant gene that causes heart failure in embryos. Since the embryos survive almost to hatching with no heart function, the defect is very observable. The axolotl is also considered an ideal animal model for the study of [neural tube] neural tube closure due to the similarities between human and axolotl [neural plate] neural plate and tube formation; the axolotl's neural tube, unlike the frog's, is not hidden under a layer of superficial [epithelium] epithelium . There are also mutations affecting other organ systems some of which are not well characterized and others that are. The genetics of the color variants of the axolotl have also been widely studied. 
=== Regeneration ===
The feature of the axolotl that attracts most attention is its healing ability: the axolotl does not heal by [scarring] scarring and is capable of the [regeneration] regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in certain cases, more vital structures, such as tail, limb, central nervous system, and tissues of the eye and heart. They can even restore less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals, including eyes and parts of the brain—restoring these alien organs to full functionality. In some cases, axolotls have been known to repair a damaged limb, as well as regenerating an additional one, ending up with an extra appendage that makes them attractive to pet owners as a novelty. In metamorphosed individuals, however, the ability to regenerate is greatly diminished. The axolotl is therefore used as a model for the development of limbs in vertebrates. There are three basic requirements for regeneration of the limb: the wound epithelium, nerve signaling, and the presence of cells from the different limb axes. A wound epidermis is quickly formed by the cells to cover up the site of the wound. In the following days, the cells of the wound epidermis divide and grow quickly forming a blastema, which means the wound is ready to heal and undergo patterning to form the new limb.
It is believed that during limb generation, axolotls have a different system to regulate their internal [macrophage] macrophage level and suppress [inflammation] inflammation , as scarring prevents proper healing and regeneration. However, this belief has been questioned by other studies. The axolotl's regenerative properties leave the species as the perfect model to study the process of stem cells and its own neoteny feature. Current research can record specific examples of these regenerative properties through tracking cell fates and behaviors, lineage tracing skin triploid cell grafts, pigmentation imaging, electroporation, tissue clearing and lineage tracing from dye labeling. The newer technologies of germline modification and transgenesis are better suited for live imaging the regenerative processes that occur for axolotls. 
=== Genome ===
The 32 billion [base pair] base pair long sequence of the axolotl's [genome] genome was published in 2018 and was the largest animal genome completed at the time. It revealed species-specific [genetic pathways] genetic pathways that may be responsible for limb regeneration. Although the axolotl genome is about 10 times as large as the [human genome] human genome , it encodes a similar number of proteins, namely 23,251 (the human genome encodes about 20,000 proteins). The size difference is mostly explained by a large fraction of [repetitive sequences] repetitive sequences , but such repeated elements also contribute to increased median [intron] intron sizes (22,759 bp) which are 13, 16 and 25 times that observed in human (1,750 bp), [mouse] mouse (1,469 bp) and [Tibetan frog] Tibetan frog (906 bp), respectively. 
=== Neoteny ===
Most amphibians begin their lives as [aquatic animals] aquatic animals which are unable to live on dry land, often being dubbed as [tadpoles] tadpoles . To reach [adulthood] adulthood , they go through a process called [metamorphosis] metamorphosis , in which they lose their gills and start living on land. However, the axolotl is unusual in that it has a lack of [thyroid-stimulating hormone] thyroid-stimulating hormone , which is needed for the [thyroid] thyroid to produce [thyroxine] thyroxine in order for the axolotl to go through metamorphosis; therefore, it keeps its gills and lives in water all its life, even after it becomes an adult and is [able to reproduce] able to reproduce . Neoteny is the term for reaching sexual maturity without undergoing metamorphosis. 
The genes responsible for neoteny in laboratory animals may have been identified; however, they are not linked in wild populations, suggesting [artificial selection] artificial selection is the cause of complete neoteny in laboratory and pet axolotls. The genes responsible have been narrowed down to a small chromosomal region called met1 met1 , which contains several candidate genes. 
The axolotl's body has the capacity to go through metamorphosis if given the necessary hormone, but axolotls do not produce it, and must be exposed to it from an external source, after which an axolotl undergoes an artificially-induced metamorphosis and begins living on land. In laboratory conditions, metamorphosis is reliably induced by administering either the thyroid hormone [thyroxine] thyroxine or [thyroid-stimulating hormone] thyroid-stimulating hormone . The former is more commonly used. 
In animals with functioning thyroid glands, iodine in the form of iodide is selectively gathered into the colloid of the thyroid. Inside the colloid, iodide is reduced to elemental iodine (I 2 2 ), which reacts with the [tyrosyl] tyrosyl residues of [thyroglobulin] thyroglobulin . Two iodinated tyrosyl residues are conjugated together. When they are cleaved from the thyroglobulin chain, thyroid hormone is obtained. 
In the absence of induced metamorphosis, larval axolotls start absorbing iodide into their thyroid glands at 30 days postfertilization. Larval axolotls do produce thyroid hormone from iodide, but the amount appears highly variable. Adult axolotls do not produce thyroid hormone unless metamorphism is triggered. 
An axolotl undergoing metamorphosis experiences a number of physiological changes that help them adapt to life on land. These include increased muscle tone in limbs, the absorption of gills and fins into the body, the development of eyelids, and a reduction in the skin's permeability to water, allowing the axolotl to stay more easily hydrated when on land. The lungs of an axolotl, though present alongside gills after reaching non-metamorphosed adulthood, develop further during metamorphosis. 
An axolotl that has gone through metamorphosis resembles an adult [plateau tiger salamander] plateau tiger salamander , though the axolotl differs in its longer toes. Among hobbyists, the process of artificially inducing metamorphosis can often result in death during or even following a successful attempt, and so casual hobbyists are generally discouraged from attempting to induce metamorphosis in pet axolotls. Morphed pet axolotls should be given solid footholds in their enclosure to satisfy their need for land. They should not be given live animals as food. 
Six adult axolotls (including a leucistic specimen) were shipped from [Mexico City] Mexico City to the Jardin des Plantes [Jardin des Plantes] Jardin des Plantes in Paris in 1863. Unaware of their neoteny, [Auguste Duméril] Auguste Duméril was surprised when, instead of the axolotl, he found in the vivarium a new species, similar to the salamander. This discovery was the starting point of research about neoteny. It is not certain that Ambystoma velasci [Ambystoma velasci] Ambystoma velasci specimens were not included in the original shipment. Vilem Laufberger in Prague used thyroid hormone injections to induce an axolotl to grow into a terrestrial adult salamander. The experiment was repeated by Englishman [Julian Huxley] Julian Huxley , who was unaware the experiment had already been done, using ground thyroids. Since then, experiments have been done often with injections of iodine or various thyroid hormones used to induce metamorphosis. 
Many other species within the axolotl's genus are also either entirely neotenic or have neotenic populations. [Sirens] Sirens and Necturus [Necturus] Necturus are other neotenic salamanders, although unlike axolotls, they cannot be induced to metamorphose by an injection of iodine or thyroxine hormone.
Neoteny has been observed in all [salamander] salamander families in which it seems to be a survival mechanism, in aquatic environments only of mountain and hill, with little food and, in particular, with little iodine. In this way, salamanders can reproduce and survive in the form of a smaller larval stage, which is aquatic and requires a lower quality and quantity of food compared to the big adult, which is terrestrial. If the salamander larvae ingest a sufficient amount of iodine, directly or indirectly through [cannibalism] cannibalism , they quickly begin metamorphosis and transform into bigger terrestrial adults, with higher dietary requirements. In fact, in some high mountain lakes there live dwarf forms of [salmonids] salmonids that are caused by deficiencies in food and, in particular, iodine, which causes [cretinism] cretinism and [dwarfism] dwarfism due to [hypothyroidism] hypothyroidism , as it does in humans.

== Threats ==
Axolotls are only native to the Mexican Central Valley. Although the native axolotl population once extended through most of the lakes and wetlands that make up this region, the native habitat is now limited to Lake Xochimilco as a result of the expansion of Mexico City. Lake Xochimilco is not a large body of water, but rather a small series of artificial channels, small lakes, and temporary wetlands.
Lake Xochimilco has poor water quality, caused by the region's aquaculture and agriculture demands. It is also maintained by inputs of only partially treated wastewater. Water quality tests reveal a low nitrogen-phosphorus ratio and a high concentration of chlorophyll a, which are indicative of an oxygen-poor environment that is not well-suited for axolotls. In addition, the intensive use of pesticides from agriculture around Lake Xochimilco causes run off into the lake and a reduction of habitat quality for axolotls. The pesticides used contain chemical compounds that studies show to sharply increase mortality in axolotl embryos and larvae. Of the surviving embryo and larvae, there is also an increase of morphological, behavior, and activity abnormalities. 
Another factor that threatens the native axolotl population is the introduction of invasive species such as the Nile tilapia and common carp. These invasive fish species threaten axolotl populations by eating their eggs or young and by out-competing them for natural resources. The presence of these species has also been shown to change the behavior of axolotls, causing them to be less active to avoid predation. This reduction in activity greatly impacts the axolotls foraging and mating opportunities. 
With such a small native population, there is a large loss of genetic diversity. This lack of genetic diversity can be dangerous for the remaining population, causing an increase in inbreeding and a decrease in general fitness and adaptive potential. It ultimately raises the axolotl's risk for extinction, something that they are already in danger of. Studies have found indicators of a low interpopulation gene flow and higher rates of genetic drift. These are likely the result of multiple “bottleneck” incidents in which events that kill off several individuals of a population occur and sharply reduce the genetic diversity of the remaining population. The offspring produced after bottleneck events have a greater risk of showing decreased fitness and are often less capable of adaptation down the line. Multiple bottleneck events can have disastrous effects on a population. Studies have also found high rates of relatedness that are indicative of inbreeding. Inbreeding can be especially harmful as it can cause an increase in the presence of deleterious, or harmful, genes within a population. The detection of introgressed tiger salamander ( A. tigrinum A. tigrinum ) DNA in the laboratory axolotl population raises further concerns about the suitability of the captive population as an ark for potential reintroduction purposes. 
There has been little improvement in the conditions of the lake or the population of native axolotls. Many scientists are focusing their conservation efforts on translocation of captive-bred individuals into new habitats or reintroduction into Lake Xochimilco. The Laboratorio de Restauracion Ecologica (LRE) in the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) has built up a population of more than 100 captive-bred individuals. These axolotls are mostly used for research by the lab but plans of a semi-artificial wetland inside the university have been established and the goal is to establish a viable population of axolotls within it. Studies have shown that captive-bred axolotls that are raised in a semi-natural environment can catch prey, survive in the wild, and have moderate success in escaping predators. These captive-bred individuals can be introduced into unpolluted bodies of water or back into Lake Xochimilco to establish or re-establish a wild population. 
== Captive care ==
The axolotl is a popular exotic pet like its relative, the tiger salamander ( Ambystoma tigrinum Ambystoma tigrinum ). As for all [poikilothermic] poikilothermic organisms, lower temperatures result in slower metabolism and a very unhealthily reduced appetite. Temperatures at approximately 16 °C (61 °F) to 18 °C (64 °F) are suggested for captive axolotls to ensure sufficient food intake; stress resulting from more than a day's exposure to lower temperatures may quickly lead to disease and death, and temperatures higher than 24 °C (75 °F) may lead to metabolic rate increase, also causing stress and eventually death.  [Chlorine] Chlorine , commonly added to [tapwater] tapwater , is harmful to axolotls. A single axolotl typically requires a 150-litre (40-US-gallon) tank. Axolotls spend the majority of the time at the bottom of the tank. 
Salts, such as [Holtfreter's solution] Holtfreter's solution , are often added to the water to prevent infection. 
In captivity, axolotls eat a variety of readily available foods, including trout and salmon pellets, frozen or live [bloodworms] bloodworms , [earthworms] earthworms , and [waxworms] waxworms . Axolotls can also eat [feeder fish] feeder fish , but care should be taken as fish may contain parasites. 
Substrates are another important consideration for captive axolotls, as axolotls (like other amphibians and reptiles) tend to ingest bedding material together with food and are commonly prone to gastrointestinal obstruction and foreign body ingestion. Some common substrates used for animal enclosures can be harmful for amphibians and reptiles. Gravel (common in aquarium use) should not be used, and is recommended that any sand consists of smooth particles with a grain size of under 1mm. One guide to axolotl care for laboratories notes that bowel obstructions are a common cause of death, and recommends that no items with a diameter below 3 cm (or approximately the size of the animal's head) should be available to the animal. 
There is some evidence that axolotls might seek out appropriately-sized gravel for use as [gastroliths] gastroliths based on experiments conducted at the University of Manitoba axolotl colony. As there is no conclusive evidence pointing to gastrolith use, gravel should be avoided due to the high risk of [impaction] impaction . 
== Cultural significance ==
The species is named after the [Aztec deity] Aztec deity  [Xolotl] Xolotl , the god of fire and lightning, who transformed himself into an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed by fellow gods. They continue to play an outsized cultural role in Mexico. Axólotl also means water monster in the [Nahuatl] Nahuatl language.
They appear in the works of Mexican muralist [Diego Rivera] Diego Rivera . In 2021, [Mexico] Mexico released a new design for its 50- [peso] peso banknote featuring an axolotl along with [maize] maize and [chinampas] chinampas on its back. It was recognized as ""Bank Note of the Year"" by the [International Bank Note Society] International Bank Note Society .  [HD 224693] HD 224693 , a [star] star in the [equatorial] equatorial  [constellation] constellation of [Cetus] Cetus , was named Axólotl in 2019. 
The [Pokémon] Pokémon  [Mudkip] Mudkip and its evolutions, added in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire [Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire] Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire (2002), take some visual inspiration from axolotls. Additionally, the Pokémon [Wooper] Wooper , added in Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal [Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal] Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal (1999), is directly based on an axolotl. The looks of the dragons Toothless and The Night Fury in the How to Train Your Dragon [How to Train Your Dragon] How to Train Your Dragon movies are based on axolotls. They were also added to the video game Minecraft [Minecraft] Minecraft in 2020. It is following [Mojang Studios] Mojang Studios ' trend of adding endangered species to the game to raise awareness. They were also added to its spin-off Minecraft: Dungeons [Minecraft: Dungeons] Minecraft: Dungeons in 2022 and are available in Lego Minecraft [Lego Minecraft] Lego Minecraft . An anthropomorphic Axolotl named Axo was also added as a purchasable outfit in Fortnite Battle Royale [Fortnite Battle Royale] Fortnite Battle Royale on August 9, 2020.

Okapi,Okapi,"
The okapi okapi ( [/oʊˈkɑːpiː/] / oʊ oʊ ˈ ˈ k k ɑː ɑː p p iː iː / ; Okapia johnstoni Okapia johnstoni Okapia johnstoni ), also known as the forest giraffe forest giraffe , Congolese giraffe Congolese giraffe and zebra giraffe zebra giraffe , is an [artiodactyl] artiodactyl  [mammal] mammal that is [endemic] endemic to the northeast [Democratic Republic of the Congo] Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. However, non-invasive genetic identification has suggested that a population has occurred south-west of the Congo River as well. It is the [only species] only species in the [genus] genus  Okapia Okapia Okapia . Although the okapi has striped markings reminiscent of [zebras] zebras , it is most closely related to the [giraffe] giraffe . The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family [Giraffidae] Giraffidae .
The okapi stands about 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder and has a typical body length around 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). Its weight ranges from 200 to 350 kg (440 to 770 lb). It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs, and white ankles. Male okapis have short, distinct horn-like protuberances on their heads called [ossicones] ossicones , less than 15 cm (5.9 in) in length. Females possess [hair whorls] hair whorls , and ossicones are absent.
Okapis are primarily [diurnal] diurnal , but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are [herbivores] herbivores , feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and [fungi] fungi . Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The [gestational period] gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.
Okapis inhabit [canopy] canopy forests at altitudes of 500–1,500 m (1,600–4,900 ft). The [International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources] International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the okapi as [endangered] endangered . Major threats include habitat loss due to [logging] logging and human settlement. [Illegal mining] Illegal mining and extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin have also led to a decline in populations. The [Okapi Conservation Project] Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations.
== Etymology and taxonomy ==
Although the okapi was unknown to the Western world until the 20th century, it may have been depicted since the early fifth century BCE on the [façade] façade of the [Apadana] Apadana at [Persepolis] Persepolis , a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the [Achaemenid] Achaemenid kingdom. 
For years, Europeans in Africa had heard of an animal that they came to call the African [unicorn] unicorn . The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering [Henry Morton Stanley] Henry Morton Stanley 's journeys in 1887. In his travelogue of exploring the Congo, Stanley mentioned a kind of [donkey] donkey that the natives called the atti atti , which scholars later identified as the okapi. 
When the British special commissioner in Uganda, [Sir Harry Johnston] Sir Harry Johnston , discovered some [Pygmy] Pygmy inhabitants of the Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The Pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on the trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast. 
Though Johnston did not see an okapi himself, he did manage to obtain pieces of striped skin and eventually a skull. From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as Okapia johnstoni Okapia johnstoni . 
Okapia johnstoni Okapia johnstoni was first described as Equus johnstoni Equus johnstoni by English zoologist [Philip Lutley Sclater] Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The [generic name] generic name  Okapia Okapia derives either from the [Mbuba] Mbuba name okapi okapi okapi or the related [Lese] Lese  [Karo] Karo name o'api o'api o'api , while the [specific name] specific name ( johnstoni johnstoni ) is in recognition of Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the [Ituri Forest] Ituri Forest . 
In 1901, Sclater presented a painting of the okapi before the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London that depicted its physical features with some clarity. Much confusion arose regarding the taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal. Sir Harry Johnston himself called it a Helladotherium [Helladotherium] Helladotherium , or a relative of other extinct giraffids. Based on the description of the okapi by Pygmies, who referred to it as a ""horse"", Sclater named the species [Equus] Equus johnstoni . Subsequently, zoologist [Ray Lankester] Ray Lankester declared that the okapi represented an unknown genus of the [Giraffidae] Giraffidae , which he placed in its own genus, Okapia Okapia , and assigned the name Okapia johnstoni Okapia johnstoni to the species. 
In 1902, Swiss zoologist [Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major] Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major suggested the inclusion of O. johnstoni O. johnstoni in the extinct giraffid subfamily [Palaeotraginae] Palaeotraginae . However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish [palaeontologist] palaeontologist  [Birger Bohlin] Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly due to the lack of a [cingulum] cingulum , a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, Okapia Okapia was finally established as a sister genus of Giraffa [Giraffa] Giraffa on the basis of [cladistic] cladistic analysis. The two genera together with Palaeotragus [Palaeotragus] Palaeotragus constitute the tribe Giraffini. 
=== Evolution ===
The earliest members of the Giraffidae first appeared in the early [Miocene] Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like [climacoceratids] climacoceratids . Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first [radiation] radiation . Another radiation began in the [Pliocene] Pliocene , but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene . Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23–10 million years ago), including Canthumeryx [Canthumeryx] Canthumeryx , Giraffokeryx [Giraffokeryx] Giraffokeryx , Palaeotragus [Palaeotragus] Palaeotragus , and Samotherium [Samotherium] Samotherium . According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, Samotherium Samotherium split into Okapia Okapia (18 million years ago) and Giraffa Giraffa (12 million years ago). However, J. D. Skinner argued that Canthumeryx Canthumeryx gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of Palaeotragus Palaeotragus . The okapi is sometimes referred to as a [living fossil] living fossil , as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. Samotherium Samotherium ). 
In 2016, a genetic study found that the common ancestor of giraffe and okapi lived about 11.5 million years ago. 
== Description ==
The okapi is a medium-sized giraffid, standing 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder. Its average body length is about 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) and its weight ranges from 200 to 350 kg (440 to 770 lb). It has a long neck, and large and flexible ears. In sharp contrast to the white horizontal stripes on the legs and white ankles, the okapi's coat is a chocolate to reddish brown.  The distinctive stripes resemble those of a zebra. These features serve as an effective camouflage amidst dense vegetation. The face, throat, and chest are greyish white. [Interdigital glands] Interdigital glands are present on all four feet, and are slightly larger on the front feet. Male okapis have short, hair-covered horn-like structures called [ossicones] ossicones , less than 15 cm (5.9 in) in length, which are similar in form and function to the ossicones of a [giraffe] giraffe . The okapi exhibits [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism , with females 4.2 cm (1.7 in) taller on average, slightly redder, and lacking prominent ossicones, instead possessing [hair whorls] hair whorls . 
The okapi shows several adaptations to its tropical habitat. The large number of [rod cells] rod cells in the retina facilitate [night vision] night vision , and an efficient [olfactory system] olfactory system is present. The large [auditory bullae] auditory bullae of the temporal bone allow a strong sense of hearing. The [dental formula] dental formula of the okapi is 0.0.3.3 0.0.3.3 3.1.3.3 3.1.3.3 . Teeth are low- [crowned] crowned and finely [cusped] cusped , and efficiently cut tender foliage. The large [cecum and colon] cecum and colon help in microbial digestion, and a quick rate of food passage allows for lower cell wall digestion than in other [ruminants] ruminants . 
The okapi is easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller than the giraffe and shares more external similarities with [bovids] bovids and [cervids] cervids . Ossicones are present only in the male okapi, while both sexes of giraffe possess this feature. The okapi has large palatine sinuses (hollow cavities in the [palate] palate ), unique among the giraffids. [Morphological] Morphological features shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a [pacing] pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on the same side of the body, unlike other [ungulates] ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body – and a long, black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful for plucking buds and leaves, as well as for grooming. 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
Okapis are primarily [diurnal] diurnal , but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. They have overlapping home ranges and typically occur at densities around 0.6 animals per square kilometre. Male home ranges average 13 km (5.0 sq mi), while female home ranges average 3–5 km (1.2–1.9 sq mi). Males migrate continuously, while females are sedentary. Males often mark territories and bushes with their urine, while females use common defecation sites. Grooming is a common practice, focused at the earlobes and the neck. Okapis often rub their necks against trees, leaving a brown [exudate] exudate . 
The male is protective of his territory, but allows females to pass through the domain to forage. Males visit female home ranges at breeding time. Although generally tranquil, the okapi can kick and butt with its head to show aggression. As the [vocal cords] vocal cords are poorly developed, vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds — ""chuff"" (contact calls used by both sexes), ""moan"" (by females during courtship) and ""bleat"" (by infants under stress). Individuals may engage in [Flehmen response] Flehmen response , a visual expression in which the animal curls back its upper lips, displays the teeth, and inhales through the mouth for a few seconds. The [leopard] leopard is the main natural predator of the okapi. 
=== Diet ===
Okapis are [herbivores] herbivores , feeding on tree leaves and buds, [branches] branches , [grasses] grasses , [ferns] ferns , fruits, and [fungi] fungi . They are unique in the Ituri Forest as they are the only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation, where they use their 18-inch-long (46 cm) tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants. The tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes. They prefer to feed in [treefall gaps] treefall gaps . The okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants, some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals. Fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates the diet of the okapi. Staple foods comprise [shrubs] shrubs and [lianas] lianas . The main constituents of the diet are woody, [dicotyledonous] dicotyledonous species; [monocotyledonous] monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families [Acanthaceae] Acanthaceae , [Ebenaceae] Ebenaceae , [Euphorbiaceae] Euphorbiaceae , [Flacourtiaceae] Flacourtiaceae , [Loganiaceae] Loganiaceae , [Rubiaceae] Rubiaceae , and [Violaceae] Violaceae . 
=== Reproduction ===
Female okapis become [sexually mature] sexually mature at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach maturity after two years. [Rut] Rut in males and [estrus] estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin [courtship] courtship by circling, smelling, and licking each other. The male shows his interest by extending his neck, tossing his head, and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and [copulation] copulation . 
The [gestational period] gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born, weighing 14–30 kg (31–66 lb). The [udder] udder of the pregnant female starts swelling 2 months before [parturition] parturition , and [vulval] vulval discharges may occur. Parturition takes 3–4 hours, and the female stands throughout this period, though she may rest during brief intervals. The mother consumes the afterbirth and extensively grooms the infant. Her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat. 
As in other ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although generally similar to adults, newborn calves have long hairs around the eye (resembling false eyelashes), a long dorsal [mane] mane , and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and give way to the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Calves are known not to defecate for the first month or two of life, which is hypothesized to help avoid predator detection in their most vulnerable phase of life. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the first few months of life, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from 3 months, and weaning takes place at 6 months. Ossicone development in males takes 1 year after birth. The okapi's typical lifespan is 20–30 years. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The okapi is [endemic] endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it occurs north and east of the [Congo River] Congo River . It ranges from the [Maiko National Park] Maiko National Park northward to the [Ituri rainforest] Ituri rainforest , then through the river basins of the Rubi, [Lake Tele] Lake Tele , and [Ebola] Ebola to the west and the [Ubangi River] Ubangi River further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo River. It is also common in the [Wamba] Wamba and Epulu areas. It is extinct in [Uganda] Uganda . 
The okapi inhabits [canopy] canopy forests at elevations of 500–1,500 m (1,600–4,900 ft). It occasionally uses seasonally inundated areas, but does not occur in [gallery forests] gallery forests , [swamp forests] swamp forests , and habitats disturbed by [human settlements] human settlements . In the wet season, it visits rocky [inselbergs] inselbergs that offer forage uncommon elsewhere. Results of research conducted in the late 1980s in a mixed Cynometra [Cynometra] Cynometra forest indicated that the okapi population density averaged 0.53 animals per square kilometre. In 2008, it was recorded in [Virunga National Park] Virunga National Park . There is also evidence that okapis were also observed in the [Semuliki Valley] Semuliki Valley in [Uganda] Uganda by Europeans, but later became extinct in the late 1970s. The Semuliki Valley provides a similar habitat to the [Congo Basin] Congo Basin .
== Status ==
=== Threats and conservation ===
The IUCN classifies the okapi as endangered. It is fully protected under Congolese law. The [Okapi Wildlife Reserve] Okapi Wildlife Reserve and [Maiko National Park] Maiko National Park support significant populations of the okapi, though a steady decline in numbers has occurred due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the [Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve] Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve ,the Abumombanzi Reserve,the [Sankuru Nature Reserve] Sankuru Nature Reserve , the [Lomami National Park] Lomami National Park . Major threats include habitat loss due to [logging] logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for [bushmeat] bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the [Virunga National Park] Virunga National Park , but lacks protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the [Okapi Wildlife Reserve] Okapi Wildlife Reserve , killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center. 
The [Okapi Conservation Project] Okapi Conservation Project , established in 1987, works towards the conservation of the okapi, as well as the growth of the indigenous [Mbuti people] Mbuti people . In November 2011, the [White Oak Conservation] White Oak Conservation center and [Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens] Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the Okapi [Species Survival Plan] Species Survival Plan and the Okapi [European Endangered Species Programme] European Endangered Species Programme at [Jacksonville] Jacksonville , which was attended by representatives from zoos from the US, Europe, and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity. 
=== Okapis in zoos ===
Around 100 okapis are in accredited [Association of Zoos and Aquariums] Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) zoos. The okapi population is managed in America by the AZA's Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that works to ensure genetic diversity in the captive population of endangered animals, while the [EEP] EEP (European studbook) and ISB (Global studbook) are managed by [Antwerp Zoo] Antwerp Zoo in Belgium, which was the first zoo to have an Okapi on display (in 1919), as well as one of the most successful in breeding them. 
In 1937, the [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo became the first in North America to acquire an okapi. With one of the most successful breeding programs, 13 calves have been born there between 1991 and 2011. The [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo has exhibited okapis since 1956, and their first okapi calf was born in 1962. Since then, there have been more than 60 okapis born at the zoo and the nearby [San Diego Zoo Safari Park] San Diego Zoo Safari Park , the most recent being Mosi, a male calf born on 21 July 2017 at the zoo. The [Brookfield Zoo] Brookfield Zoo in [Chicago] Chicago has also greatly contributed to the captive population of okapis in accredited zoos. The zoo has had 28 okapi births since 1959. 
Other North American zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include: [Denver Zoo] Denver Zoo and [Cheyenne Mountain Zoo] Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (Colorado); [Houston Zoo] Houston Zoo , [Dallas Zoo] Dallas Zoo , and [San Antonio Zoo] San Antonio Zoo (Texas); [Disney's Animal Kingdom] Disney's Animal Kingdom , [White Oak Conservation] White Oak Conservation , [Zoo Miami] Zoo Miami , and [ZooTampa at Lowry Park] ZooTampa at Lowry Park (Florida); [Los Angeles Zoo] Los Angeles Zoo , [Sacramento Zoo] Sacramento Zoo , and [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo (California); [Saint Louis Zoo] Saint Louis Zoo (Missouri); [Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden] Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and [Columbus Zoo and Aquarium] Columbus Zoo and Aquarium (Ohio); [Memphis Zoo] Memphis Zoo and [Nashville Zoo] Nashville Zoo (Tennessee); [The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore] The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore (Maryland); [Sedgwick County Zoo] Sedgwick County Zoo and [Tanganyika Wildlife Park] Tanganyika Wildlife Park (Kansas); [Roosevelt Park Zoo] Roosevelt Park Zoo (North Dakota); [Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium] Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium (Nebraska); [Philadelphia Zoo] Philadelphia Zoo (Pennsylvania); [Potawatomi Zoo] Potawatomi Zoo (Indiana); [Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden] Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden (Oklahoma); [Blank Park Zoo] Blank Park Zoo (Iowa); and [Potter Park Zoo] Potter Park Zoo (Michigan). 
In Europe, zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include: [Chester Zoo] Chester Zoo , [London Zoo] London Zoo , [Marwell Zoo] Marwell Zoo , [The Wild Place] The Wild Place , and [Yorkshire Wildlife Park] Yorkshire Wildlife Park (United Kingdom); [Dublin Zoo] Dublin Zoo (Ireland); [Berlin Zoo] Berlin Zoo , [Frankfurt Zoo] Frankfurt Zoo , [Wilhelma Zoo] Wilhelma Zoo , [Wuppertal Zoo] Wuppertal Zoo , [Cologne Zoo] Cologne Zoo , and [Leipzig Zoo] Leipzig Zoo (Germany); [Zoo Basel] Zoo Basel (Switzerland); [Copenhagen Zoo] Copenhagen Zoo (Denmark); [Rotterdam Zoo] Rotterdam Zoo and [Safaripark Beekse Bergen] Safaripark Beekse Bergen (Netherlands); [Antwerp Zoo] Antwerp Zoo (Belgium); [Dvůr Králové Zoo] Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic); [Wrocław Zoo] Wrocław Zoo (Poland); [Bioparc Zoo de Doué] Bioparc Zoo de Doué and [ZooParc de Beauval] ZooParc de Beauval (France); and [Lisbon Zoo] Lisbon Zoo (Portugal). 
In Asia, three Japanese zoos exhibit okapis: [Ueno Zoo] Ueno Zoo in Tokyo; [Kanazawa Zoo] Kanazawa Zoo and [Zoorasia] Zoorasia in Yokohama.

Quagga,Quagga,"
The quagga quagga ( [/ˈkwɑːxɑː/] / ˈ ˈ k k w w ɑː ɑː x x ɑː ɑː / or [/ˈkwæɡə/] / ˈ ˈ k k w w æ æ ɡ ɡ ə ə / ) ( Equus quagga quagga Equus quagga quagga Equus quagga quagga ) is an extinct [subspecies] subspecies of the [plains zebra] plains zebra that was [endemic] endemic to [South Africa] South Africa until it was hunted to [extinction] extinction in the late 19th century. It was long thought to be a distinct species, but [MtDNA] MtDNA studies have supported it being a subspecies of plains zebra. A more recent study suggested that it was the southernmost [cline] cline or [ecotype] ecotype of the species.
The quagga is believed to have been around 257 cm (8 ft 5 in) long and 125–135 cm (4 ft 1 in – 4 ft 5 in) tall at the shoulders. It was distinguished from other [zebras] zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and appeared more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about the quagga's behaviour, but it may have gathered into herds of 30–50. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than the related [Burchell's zebra] Burchell's zebra . They were once found in great numbers in the [Karoo] Karoo of [Cape Province] Cape Province and the southern part of the [Orange Free State] Orange Free State in South Africa.
After the [European settlement of South Africa] European settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was extensively hunted, as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. Some were taken to zoos in Europe, but breeding programmes were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State; the quagga was [extinct in the wild] extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive, and only 23 skins exist today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal whose [DNA] DNA was analysed. The [Quagga Project] Quagga Project has attempted to breed Burchell's zebras with similar striping patterns to the quagga.
== Taxonomy ==
It has been historically suggested that the name quagga quagga is derived from the [Khoikhoi] Khoikhoi word for zebra [zebra] zebra ( [cf.] cf.  [Tshwa] Tshwa  llkoaah llkoaah llkoaah 'zebra' ), thereby being an [onomatopoeic] onomatopoeic word, resembling the quagga's call, variously transcribed as ""kwa-ha-ha"", ""kwahaah"", or ""oug-ga"". The name is still used [colloquially] colloquially for the [plains zebra] plains zebra . 
The quagga was originally classified as a distinct [species] species , Equus quagga Equus quagga , in 1778 by Dutch naturalist [Pieter Boddaert] Pieter Boddaert . Traditionally, the quagga and the other plains and mountain zebras were placed in the [subgenus] subgenus  Hippotigris [Hippotigris] Hippotigris . Much debate has occurred over the status of the quagga in relation to the plains zebra. The  British zoologist [Reginald Innes Pocock] Reginald Innes Pocock in 1902 was perhaps the first to suggest that the quagga was a [subspecies] subspecies of the plains zebra. As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the [trinomial name] trinomial name for the quagga becomes E. quagga quagga E. quagga quagga under this scheme, and the other subspecies of the plains zebra are placed under E. quagga E. quagga , as well. 
Historically, quagga taxonomy was further complicated because the extinct southernmost population of [Burchell's zebra] Burchell's zebra ( Equus quagga burchellii Equus quagga burchellii , formerly Equus burchellii burchellii Equus burchellii burchellii ) was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, E. burchellii E. burchellii ). The extant northern population, the ""Damara zebra"", was later named Equus quagga antiquorum Equus quagga antiquorum , which means that it is today also referred to as E. q. burchellii E. q. burchellii , after it was realised they were the same [taxon] taxon . The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts. As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus Quagga Quagga in 1934. Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a [cline] cline . 
Different subspecies of plains zebras were recognised as members of Equus quagga Equus quagga by early researchers, though much confusion existed over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described on the basis of differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to [individual variation] individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus Hippotigris isabellinus , were based only on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. One [craniometric] craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the [horse] horse ( Equus ferus caballus Equus ferus caballus ), but early [morphological] morphological studies have been noted as being erroneous. Studying skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used [donkey] donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable. 
=== Evolution ===
The quagga is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected at a time when the name ""quagga"" referred to all zebras. Fossil skulls of Equus mauritanicus [Equus mauritanicus] Equus mauritanicus from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, but they may be too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them. 
The quagga was the first extinct animal to have its [DNA] DNA analysed, and this 1984 study launched the field of [ancient DNA] ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses, with the quagga and [mountain zebra] mountain zebra ( Equus zebra Equus zebra ) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An [immunological] immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the [mtDNA] mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2 percent per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra. 
Later morphological studies came to different conclusions. A 1999 analysis of cranial measurements found that the quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species. 
A [genetic study] genetic study published in 2005 confirmed the subspecific status of the quagga. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity, and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, during the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene , and possibly the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern perhaps evolved rapidly because of geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all. Other large African [ungulates] ungulates diverged into separate species and subspecies during this period, as well, probably because of the same climate shift. 
The simplified [cladogram] cladogram below is based on the 2005 analysis (some taxa shared [haplotypes] haplotypes and could, therefore, not be differentiated): 
[Mountain zebra] Mountain zebra ( E. zebra E. zebra )
[Grévy's zebra] Grévy's zebra ( E. grevyi E. grevyi )
Quagga Quagga ( E. q. quagga E. q. quagga E. q. quagga )
[Damara zebra] Damara zebra ( E. q. antiquorum E. q. antiquorum )- [Chapman's zebra] Chapman's zebra ( E. q. chapmani E. q. chapmani )
[Grant's zebra] Grant's zebra ( E. q. boehmi E. q. boehmi )
A 2018 genetic study of plains zebras populations confirmed the quagga as a member of that species. They found no evidence for subspecific differentiation based on morphological differences between southern populations of zebras, including the quagga. Modern plains zebra populations may have originated from southern Africa, and the quagga appears to be less divergent from neighbouring populations than the northernmost living population in northeastern [Uganda] Uganda . Instead, the study supported a north–south genetic continuum for plains zebras, with the Ugandan population being the most distinct. Zebras from [Namibia] Namibia appear to be the closest genetically to the quagga. 
== Description ==
The quagga is believed to have been 257 cm (8 ft 5 in) long and 125–135 cm (4 ft 1 in – 4 ft 5 in) tall at the shoulders. Based on measurements of skins, mares were significantly longer and slightly taller than stallions, whereas the stallions of extant zebras are the largest. Its coat pattern was unique among [equids] equids : zebra-like in the front but more like a horse in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of [polymorphism] polymorphism , with some having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing [mane] mane with brown and white stripes. 
The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a [mare] mare at the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London 's [Zoo] Zoo . Five photographs of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. The German naturalist [Reinhold Rau] Reinhold Rau , pioneer of the [Quagga Project] Quagga Project , claimed that this is an [optical illusion] optical illusion : that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. 
Living in the very southern end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick [winter coat] winter coat that [moulted] moulted each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a [concave] concave  [diastema] diastema , and as being relatively broad with a narrow [occiput] occiput . Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a [dewlap] dewlap on its neck as the mountain zebra does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibits limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The quagga was the southernmost distributed plains zebra, mainly living south of the [Orange River] Orange River . It was a grazer, and its habitat range was restricted to the grasslands and arid interior scrubland of the [Karoo] Karoo region of [South Africa] South Africa , today forming parts of the provinces of [Northern Cape] Northern Cape , [Eastern Cape] Eastern Cape , [Western Cape] Western Cape , and the [Free State] Free State . These areas were known for distinctive flora and fauna and high amounts of [endemism] endemism . Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30–50, and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been [sympatric] sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the [Vaal] Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, and there is no evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with [Hartmann's mountain zebra] Hartmann's mountain zebra ( Equus zebra hartmannae Equus zebra hartmannae ). 
Little is known about the behaviour of quaggas in the wild, and it is sometimes unclear what exact species of zebra is referred to in old reports. The only source that unequivocally describes the quagga in the Free State is that of the British military engineer and hunter [William Cornwallis Harris] William Cornwallis Harris . His 1840 account reads as follows:
The geographical range of the quagga does not appear to extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their [leaves] leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.
The practical [function of striping] function of striping in zebras has been debated and it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A [cryptic] cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided [species recognition] species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as [thermoregulation] thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with this is that the mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity than other zebras. 
A 2020 study suggested that the [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism in size, with quagga mares being larger than stallions, could be due to the cold and droughts that affects the Karoo plateau, conditions that were even more severe in prehistoric times, such as during [ice ages] ice ages (other plains zebras live in warmer areas). Isolation, cold, and aridity could thereby have affected quagga evolution, including coat colour and size dimorphism. Since plains zebra mares are pregnant or lactate for much of their lives, larger size could have been a selective advantage for quagga mares, as they would therefore have more food reserves when food was scarce. Dimorphism and coat colour could also have evolved through [genetic drift] genetic drift due to isolation, but these influences are not mutually exclusive, and could have worked together. 
== Relationship with humans ==
Quaggas have been identified in [cave art] cave art attributed to the indigenous [San people] San people of Southern Africa. As it was easy to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by [Afrikaners] Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or exploited. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. Quaggas were said to be lively and highly strung, especially the stallions. Quaggas were brought to European zoos, and an attempt at captive breeding was made at London Zoo, but this was halted when a lone stallion killed itself by bashing itself against a wall after losing its temper. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos were said to be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra. One specimen was reported to have lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872. 
The quagga was long regarded a suitable candidate for domestication, as it counted as the most docile of the zebras. The Dutch colonists in South Africa had considered this possibility, because their imported work horses did not perform very well in the extreme climate and regularly fell prey to the feared [African horse sickness] African horse sickness . In 1843, the English naturalist [Charles Hamilton Smith] Charles Hamilton Smith wrote that the quagga was 'unquestionably best calculated for domestication, both as regards strength and docility'. Some mentions have been given of tame or domesticated quaggas in South Africa. In Europe, two stallions were used to drive a [phaeton] phaeton by the sheriff of London in the early 19th century. 
In an attempt at domesticating the quagga, the British lord [George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton] George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton obtained a single male which he bred with a female horse of partial [Arabian] Arabian ancestry. This produced a female [hybrid] hybrid with stripes on its back and legs. [Lord Morton's mare] Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the [Royal Society] Royal Society . It is unknown what happened to the hybrid mare itself. This led to new ideas on [telegony] telegony , referred to as [pangenesis] pangenesis by the British naturalist [Charles Darwin] Charles Darwin . At the close of the 19th century, the Scottish zoologist [James Cossar Ewart] James Cossar Ewart argued against these ideas and proved, with several cross-breeding experiments, that zebra stripes could appear as an [atavistic] atavistic trait at any time. 
There are 23 known stuffed and mounted quagga specimens throughout the world, including a juvenile, two foals, and a foetus. In addition, a mounted head and neck, a foot, seven complete skeletons, and samples of various tissues remain. A 24th mounted specimen was destroyed in [Königsberg] Königsberg , Germany, during [World War II] World War II , and various skeletons and bones have also been lost. 
=== Extinction ===
The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the [Orange Free State] Orange Free State , was [extirpated] extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild quagga died in 1878. The specimen in London died in 1872 and the one in Berlin in 1875. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam's [Natura Artis Magistra] Natura Artis Magistra zoo, lived there from 9 May 1867 until it died on 12 August 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear. Its death was not recognised as signifying the extinction of its kind at the time, and the zoo requested another specimen; hunters believed it could still be found ""closer to the interior"" in the Cape Colony. Since locals used the term quagga to refer to all zebras, this may have led to the confusion. The extinction of the quagga was internationally accepted by the 1900 [Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa] Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa . The last specimen was featured on a Dutch stamp in 1988. The specimen itself was mounted and is kept in the collection of [Naturalis Biodiversity Center] Naturalis Biodiversity Center in [Leiden] Leiden . It has been on display for special occasions. 
In 1889, the naturalist [Henry Bryden] Henry Bryden wrote: ""That an animal so beautiful, so capable of domestication and use, and to be found not long since in so great abundance, should have been allowed to be swept from the face of the earth, is surely a disgrace to our latter-day civilization."" 
=== Breeding back project ===
After the very close relationship between the quagga and extant plains zebras was discovered, Rau started the Quagga Project in 1987 in South Africa to create a quagga-like zebra population by [selectively breeding] selectively breeding for a reduced stripe pattern from plains zebra stock, with the eventual aim of introducing them to the quagga's former range. To differentiate between the quagga and the zebras of the project, they refer to it as ""Rau quaggas"". The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, participants in the project plan to release them in the Western Cape. 
Introduction of these quagga-like zebras could be part of a comprehensive restoration programme, including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, [wildebeest] wildebeest , and [ostriches] ostriches , which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third- and fourth-generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called [breeding back] breeding back . The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for [cloning] cloning has not yet been developed.

Narwhal,Narwhal,"
The narwhal narwhal ( Monodon monoceros Monodon monoceros Monodon monoceros ) is a [species] species of [toothed whale] toothed whale native to the [Arctic] Arctic . It is the only member of the [genus] genus  Monodon Monodon Monodon and one of two living representatives of the family Monodontidae [Monodontidae] Monodontidae . The narwhal has a similar build to the closely related [beluga whale] beluga whale , with which it overlaps in range and can [interbreed] interbreed . It is a stocky cetacean with a relatively blunt snout, a large [melon] melon , and a shallow ridge in place of a [dorsal fin] dorsal fin . Males of this species have a large 1.5–3.0 m (4 ft 11 in – 9 ft 10 in) long [tusk] tusk , which is a left protruded [canine] canine thought to serve as a weapon or as a tool for feeding, [attracting mates] attracting mates or sensing water salinity. Specially adapted [slow-twitch muscles] slow-twitch muscles , along with the jointed neck vertebrae and shallow dorsal ridge allow for easy movement through the Arctic environment, where the narwhal spends extended periods at great depths.
The narwhal inhabits the [Arctic waters] Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland and Russia. Every year, it [migrates] migrates to ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters, and often [returns] returns to the same sites in subsequent years. Its diet mainly consists of [polar] polar and [Arctic cod] Arctic cod , [Greenland halibut] Greenland halibut , [cuttlefish] cuttlefish , [shrimp] shrimp , and [armhook squid] armhook squid . Plunging at depths of up to 2,370 m (7,780 ft), the narwhal is among the deepest-diving [cetaceans] cetaceans . It travels in groups of three to eight, with aggregations of up to 1,000 occurring in the summer months. It mates in the offshore [pack ice] pack ice from March to May, and the young are born in July or August of the following year. When communicating, a variety of clicks, whistles and knocks are used.
There are an estimated 170,000 living narwhals, and the species is listed as being of [least concern] least concern by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population is threatened by the [effects of climate change] effects of climate change , such as the [reduction in ice cover] reduction in ice cover , and human activities such as [pollution] pollution and [hunting] hunting . The narwhal has been hunted for thousands of years by [Inuit] Inuit in northern Canada and Greenland for [meat] meat and [ivory] ivory , and regulated subsistence hunts continue.
== Taxonomy ==
The narwhal was scientifically described by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 [Systema Naturae] Systema Naturae Systema Naturae . The word ""narwhal"" comes from the [Old Norse] Old Norse  nárhval nárhval nárhval , meaning 'corpse-whale', which possibly refers to the animal's grey, mottled skin and its habit of remaining motionless when at the water's surface, a behaviour known as ""logging"" that usually happens in the summer. The scientific name, Monodon monoceros Monodon monoceros , is derived from [Greek] Greek : 'single-tooth single-horn'. 
The narwhal is most closely related to the [beluga whale] beluga whale ( Delphinapterus leucas Delphinapterus leucas ). Together, these two species comprise the only [extant] extant members of the family Monodontidae [Monodontidae] Monodontidae , sometimes referred to as the ""white whales"". The Monodontidae Monodontidae are distinguished by their pronounced [melons] melons (acoustic sensory organs), short [snouts] snouts and the absence of a true [dorsal fin] dorsal fin . 
Although the narwhal and beluga are classified as separate genera, there is some evidence that they may, very rarely, [interbreed] interbreed . The remains of an abnormal-looking whale, described by marine zoologists as unlike any known species, were found in West Greenland around 1990. It had features midway between a narwhal and a beluga, indicating that the remains belonged to a [narluga] narluga (a hybrid between the two species); this was confirmed by a 2019 [DNA analysis] DNA analysis . Whether the hybrid [could breed] could breed remains unknown. 
=== Evolution ===
Results of a genetic study reveal that [porpoises] porpoises and white whales are closely related, forming a separate [clade] clade which diverged from [dolphins] dolphins about 11 million years ago. A 2018 molecular analysis of Monodontidae Monodontidae fossils indicates that they had separated from Phocoenidae Phocoenidae around 10.82 to 20.12 mya; they are considered to be a [sister taxon] sister taxon . A later 2020 [phylogenetic study] phylogenetic study based on [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA suggested that, around 4.98 [million years ago] million years ago (mya), the narwhal split from the beluga whale. 
The fossil species Casatia thermophila [Casatia thermophila] Casatia thermophila of [early Pliocene] early Pliocene central Italy was described as a possible narwhal ancestor when it was discovered in 2019. Bohaskaia [Bohaskaia] Bohaskaia , Denebola [Denebola] Denebola and Haborodelphis [Haborodelphis] Haborodelphis were other extinct genera known during the [Pliocene] Pliocene of the eastern and western United States. Fossil evidence shows that ancient white whales lived in tropical waters. They may have migrated to Arctic and subarctic waters in response to changes in the marine food chain.

== Description ==
The narwhal has a thickset body with a short, blunt snout, small upcurved flippers, and convex to concave tail flukes. Adults measure in body-to-tail length from 3.0 to 5.5 m (9.8 to 18.0 ft) and weigh 800 to 1,600 kg (1,800 to 3,500 lb). Male narwhals attain [sexual maturity] sexual maturity at 12 to 20 years of age, reaching a length of 3.5 to 4.0 m (11.5 to 13.1 ft). Females become sexually mature at a younger age, between 8 and 9 years old, when they are about 3.4 m (11 ft) long. On average, males are about 70 cm (28 in) longer and more than 75% heavier than females. 
The [pigmentation] pigmentation of the narwhal is a [mottled pattern] mottled pattern , with blackish-brown markings over a white background. At birth, the skin is light grey, and when sexually mature, white patches grow on the [navel] navel and [genital slit] genital slit . This whitening occurs throughout life, resulting in aged narwhals that are almost pure white. Unlike most whales, the narwhal has a shallow dorsal ridge, rather than a dorsal fin, possibly an [evolutionary adaptation] evolutionary adaptation to make swimming under ice easier or to facilitate rolling. The neck [vertebrae] vertebrae are jointed, instead of being fused as in most whales; this allows a greater range of neck flexibility. These characteristics—a dorsal ridge and jointed neck vertebrae—are shared by the beluga whale. Male and female narwhals have different tail flukes; the former are bent inward, while the latter have a sweep-back on the front margins. This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing [drag] drag caused by the tusk. 
Compared with most marine mammals, the narwhal has a higher amount of [myoglobin] myoglobin in its body, which facilitates deeper dives. It has a dense layer of [blubber] blubber , around 50 to 100 mm (2.0 to 3.9 in) thick. This fat accounts for a third of the body mass and helps insulate from cold ocean temperatures.  [Skeletal muscles] Skeletal muscles in the narwhal are highly adapted for prolonged periods of deep-sea foraging. During such activities, oxygen is reserved in the muscles, which are typically [slow-twitch] slow-twitch , allowing for endurance and manoeuvrable motion. 
=== Tusk ===
The most conspicuous characteristic of the male narwhal is a long, spiralled tusk, which is a [canine tooth] canine tooth that projects from the left side of the upper jaw. Both sexes have a pair of tusks embedded in the upper jaw, which in males erupts at two or three. The tusk grows throughout the animal's life, reaching lengths of 1.5 to 3 m (4 ft 11 in to 9 ft 10 in). It is hollow and weighs up to 7.45 kg (16.4 lb). Some males may grow two tusks, occurring when the right canine also protrudes through the lip. Females rarely grow tusks: when they do, the tusks are typically smaller than those of males, with less noticeable spirals. 
The function of the narwhal tusk is debated. Some biologists suggest that narwhals use their tusks in fights, while others argue that they may be of use in feeding. There is, however, a [scientific consensus] scientific consensus that tusks are [secondary sexual characteristics] secondary sexual characteristics which indicate social status. The tusk is also a highly [innervated] innervated  [sensory organ] sensory organ with millions of [nerve endings] nerve endings that connect seawater stimuli to the brain, allowing the narwhal to sense temperature variability in its surroundings. These nerves may be able to pick up the slightest increase or decrease in the magnitude of particles and water pressure. According to Dr. Martin Nweeia, male narwhals may rid themselves of encrustations on their tusks by rubbing them together, as opposed to posturing displays of aggressive male-to-male rivalry.  [Drone] Drone footage from August 2016 in Tremblay Sound, [Nunavut] Nunavut , revealed that narwhals used their tusks to tap and [stun] stun small [Arctic cod] Arctic cod , making them easier to catch for feeding. Females, who usually do not have tusks, live longer than males, hence the tusk cannot be essential to the animal's survival. It is generally accepted that the primary function of the narwhal tusk is associated with [sexual selection] sexual selection . 
=== Vestigial teeth ===
The narwhal has a single pair of small [vestigial] vestigial teeth that reside in open [tooth sockets] tooth sockets in the upper jaw. These teeth, which differ in form and composition, encircle the exposed tooth sockets laterally, posteriorly, and ventrally. Vestigial teeth in male narwhals are commonly shed in the [palate] palate . The varied morphology and anatomy of small teeth indicate a path of evolutionary obsolescence. 
== Distribution ==
The narwhal is found in the Atlantic and Russian areas of the [Arctic Ocean] Arctic Ocean . Individuals are commonly recorded in the [Canadian Arctic Archipelago] Canadian Arctic Archipelago , such as in the northern part of [Hudson Bay] Hudson Bay , [Hudson Strait] Hudson Strait , [Baffin Bay] Baffin Bay ; off the east coast of Greenland; and in a strip running east from the northern end of Greenland round to eastern Russia ( [170° east] 170° east ). Land in this strip includes [Svalbard] Svalbard , [Franz Joseph Land] Franz Joseph Land and [Severnaya Zemlya] Severnaya Zemlya . The northernmost sightings of narwhals have occurred north of Franz Joseph Land, at about [85° north] 85° north . There are an estimated 12,500 narwhals in northern Hudson Bay, whereas around 140,000 reside in Baffin Bay. 
=== Migration ===
Narwhals exhibit [seasonal migration] seasonal migration , with a high [fidelity of return] fidelity of return to preferred ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters. In summer months, they move closer to coasts, often in pods of 10–100. In the winter, they move to offshore, deeper waters under thick [pack ice] pack ice , surfacing in narrow fissures or in wider fractures known as [leads] leads . As spring comes, these leads open up into channels and the narwhals return to the coastal [bays] bays . Narwhals in Baffin Bay typically travel further north, to northern Canada and Greenland, between June and September. After this period, they travel about 1,700 kilometres (1,100 mi) south to the [Davis Strait] Davis Strait , and stay there until April. During winter, narwhals from Canada and West Greenland regularly visit the pack ice of the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay along the [continental slope] continental slope which contains less than 5% open water and hosts high densities of [Greenland halibut] Greenland halibut . 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Narwhals normally [congregate in groups] congregate in groups of three to eight—and sometimes up to twenty—individuals. Groups may be ""nurseries"" with only females and young, or can contain only juveniles or adult males (""bulls""); mixed groups can occur at any time of year. In the summer, several groups come together, forming larger aggregations which can contain 500 to over 1,000 individuals. Male narwhals have been observed rubbing each other's tusks, a behaviour known as ""tusking"". 
When in their wintering waters, narwhals make some of the deepest dives recorded for cetaceans, diving to at least 800 m (2,620 ft) over 15 times per day, with many dives reaching 1,500 m (4,920 ft). The greatest dive depth recorded is 2,370 m (7,780 ft). Dives last up to 25 minutes, but can vary in depth, depending on the season and local variation between environments. For example, in the Baffin Bay wintering grounds, narwhals tend to dive deep within the precipitous coasts, typically south of Baffin Bay. This suggests differences in habitat structure, prey availability, or genetic adaptations between subpopulations. In the northern wintering grounds, narwhals do not dive as deep as the southern population, in spite of greater water depths in these areas. This is mainly attributed to prey being concentrated nearer to the surface, which causes narwhals to alter their foraging strategies. 
=== Diet ===
Narwhals have a restricted and specialised diet. Due to the lack of well-developed [dentition] dentition , narwhals are believed to feed by swimming close to prey and [sucking] sucking them into the mouth. A study of the stomach contents of 73 narwhals found Arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida [Boreogadus saida] Boreogadus saida ) to be the most commonly consumed prey, followed by Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides [Reinhardtius hippoglossoides] Reinhardtius hippoglossoides ). Large quantities of Boreo-Atlantic armhook squid ( Gonatus fabricii [Gonatus fabricii] Gonatus fabricii ) were discovered. Males were more likely than females to consume two additional prey species: polar cod ( Arctogadus glacialis [Arctogadus glacialis] Arctogadus glacialis ) and redfish ( Sebastes marinus [Sebastes marinus] Sebastes marinus ), both of which are found in depths of more than 500 m (1,600 ft). The study also concluded that the size of prey did not differ among genders or ages. Other items found in stomachs have included [wolffish] wolffish , [capelin] capelin , [skate] skate eggs and sometimes rocks. 
Narwhal diet varies by season. In winter, narwhals feed on [demersal] demersal prey, mostly [flatfish] flatfish , under dense pack ice. During the summer, they eat mostly Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet. Narwhals consume more food in the winter months than they do in summer. 
=== Breeding ===
Most female narwhals reproduce by the time they are six to eight years old.  [Courtship] Courtship and [mating] mating behaviour for the species has been recorded from March to May, when they are in offshore pack ice, and is thought to involve a dominant male mating with several partners. The average [gestation] gestation lasts 15 months, and births appear to be most frequent between July and August. A female has a birth interval of around 2–3 years. As with most marine mammals, only a single young is born, averaging 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length with white or light grey pigmentation. Summer population surveys along different coastal inlets of [Baffin Island] Baffin Island found that calf numbers varied from 0.05% of 35,000 in [Admiralty Inlet] Admiralty Inlet , to 5% of 10,000 total in [Eclipse Sound] Eclipse Sound . These findings suggest that higher calf counts may reflect calving and nursery habitats in favourable inlets. 
Newborn calves begin their lives with a thin layer of blubber. The blubber thickens as they [nurse] nurse their mother's milk, which is rich in fat; calves are dependent on milk for about 20 months. This long lactation period gives calves time to learn skills they will need to survive as they mature. 
Narwhals are among the few animals that undergo [menopause] menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. Females in this phase may continue to protect calves in the pod. A 2024 study concluded that five species of [Odontoceti] Odontoceti evolved menopause to acquire higher overall longevity, though their reproductive periods did not change. To explain this, scientists hypothesised that calves of the five Odontoceti species require the assistance of menopausal females for an enhanced chance at survival, as they are extremely difficult for a single female to successfully rear. 
=== Communication ===
Like most toothed whales, narwhals use sound to navigate and hunt for food. They primarily vocalise through clicks, whistles and knocks, created by air movement between chambers near the [blowhole] blowhole . The frequency of these sounds ranges from 0.3 to 125 [hertz] hertz , while those used for [echolocation] echolocation typically fall between 19 and 48 hertz. Sounds are reflected off the sloping front of the skull and focused by the animal's melon, which can be controlled through surrounding musculature. Echolocation clicks are used for detecting prey and locating barriers at short distances. Whistles and throbs are most commonly used to communicate with other pod members. Calls recorded from the same pod are more similar than calls from different pods, suggesting the possibility of group- or individual-specific calls. Narwhals sometimes adjust the duration and pitch of their pulsed calls to maximise sound propagation in varying acoustic environments. Other sounds produced by narwhals include trumpeting and ""squeaking-door sounds"". The narwhal vocal repertoire is similar to that of the beluga whale. However, the frequency ranges, durations, and repetition rates of narwhal clicks differ from those of belugas. 
=== Longevity and mortality factors ===
Age determination techniques using the number of [periosteum] periosteum layers in the [lower jaw] lower jaw reveal that narwhals live an average of 50 years, though techniques using [amino acid dating] amino acid dating from the [lens] lens of the eyes suggest that female narwhals can reach 115   ±   10 years and male narwhals can live to 84   ±   9 years. 
Death by [suffocation] suffocation often occurs when narwhals fail to migrate before the [Arctic freezes over] Arctic freezes over in late autumn. This is known as ""sea-ice entrapment"". Narwhals drown if open water is no longer accessible and ice is too thick for them to break through. Breathing holes in ice may be up to 1,450 m (4,760 ft) apart, which limits the use of foraging grounds. These holes must be at least 0.5 m (1.6 ft) wide to allow an adult whale to breathe. Narwhals also die of [starvation] starvation from entrapment events. 
In 1914–1915, around 1,000 narwhal carcasses were discovered after entrapment events, most occurring in areas such as [Disko Bay] Disko Bay in [West Greenland] West Greenland . Several cases of sea entrapment were recorded in 2008–2010, during the Arctic winter, including in some places where such events had never been recorded before. This suggests later departure dates from summering grounds. Wind and currents move sea ice from adjacent locations to Greenland, leading to fluctuations in concentration. Due to their tendency of returning to the same areas, changes in weather and ice conditions are not always associated with narwhal movement toward open water. It is currently unclear to what extent sea ice changes pose a danger to narwhals. 
Narwhals are preyed upon by [polar bears] polar bears and [orcas] orcas . In some instances, the former have been recorded waiting at breathing holes for young narwhals, while the latter were observed surrounding and killing entire narwhal pods. To escape predators such as orcas, narwhals may use prolonged submersion to hide under [ice floes] ice floes rather than relying on speed. 
Researchers found Brucella [Brucella] Brucella in the bloodstreams of numerous narwhals throughout the course of a 19-year study. They were also recorded with [whale lice] whale lice species such as Cyamus monodontis [Cyamus monodontis] Cyamus monodontis and Cyamus nodosus [Cyamus nodosus] Cyamus nodosus . Other [pathogens] pathogens include Toxoplasma gondii [Toxoplasma gondii] Toxoplasma gondii , [morbillivirus] morbillivirus , and [papillomavirus] papillomavirus . In 2018, a female narwhal had [alphaherpesvirus] alphaherpesvirus in her system. 
== Conservation ==
The narwhal is listed as a species of [least concern] least concern by the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List . As of 2017, the global population is estimated to be 123,000 mature individuals out of a total of 170,000. There were about 12,000 narwhals in Northern Hudson Bay in 2011, and around 49,000 near [Somerset Island] Somerset Island in 2013. There are approximately a total of 35,000 in [Admiralty Inlet] Admiralty Inlet , 10,000 in Eclipse Sound, 17,000 in [Eastern Baffin Bay] Eastern Baffin Bay , and 12,000 in [Jones Sound] Jones Sound . Population numbers in [Smith Sound] Smith Sound , [Inglefield Bredning] Inglefield Bredning and [Melville Bay] Melville Bay are 16,000, 8,000 and 3,000, respectively. There are roughly 800 narwhals in the waters off Svalbard. 
In the 1972 [Marine Mammal Protection Act] Marine Mammal Protection Act , the United States banned imports of products made from narwhal parts. They are listed on Appendix II of the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and [Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals] Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). These committees restrict international trading of live animals and their body parts, as well as implement sustainable action plans. The species is classified as special concern under the [Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada] Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), which aims to classify the risk levels of species in the country. 
=== Threats ===
Narwhals are hunted for their skin, [meat] meat , teeth, tusks and [carved vertebrae] carved vertebrae , which are commercially traded. About 1,000 narwhals are killed per year: 600 in Canada and 400 in Greenland. Canadian catches were steady at this level in the 1970s, dropped to 300–400 per year in the late 1980s and 1990s and have risen again since 1999. Greenland caught more, 700–900 per year, in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Narwhal tusks are sold both carved and uncarved in Canada and Greenland. Per hunted narwhal, an average of one or two vertebrae and one or two teeth are sold. In Greenland, the skin ( muktuk muktuk [muktuk] muktuk ) is sold commercially to [fish factories] fish factories , and in Canada to other communities. Based on an analysis of 2007 narwhal hunts in Hudson Bay, a 2013 paper estimated that gross revenue per narwhal was CA$6,542 CA$6,542 (US$6,091). Hunts receive [subsidies] subsidies , but they continue mainly to support tradition, rather than for profit. Economic analysis noted that [whale watching] whale watching may be an alternate source of revenue. 
As narwhals grow, [bioaccumulation] bioaccumulation of heavy metals takes place. It is thought that [pollution in the ocean] pollution in the ocean is the primary cause of bioaccumulation in marine mammals; this may lead to health problems for the narwhal population. When bioaccumulating, numerous metals appear in the blubber, liver, kidney and musculature. A study found that the blubber was nearly devoid of these metals, whereas the liver and kidneys had a dense concentration of them. Relative to the liver, the kidney has a greater concentration of [zinc] zinc and [cadmium] cadmium , while [lead] lead , [copper] copper and [mercury] mercury were not nearly as abundant. Individuals of different weight and sex showed dissimilarities in the concentration of metals in their organs. 
Narwhals are one of the Arctic marine mammals most vulnerable to [climate change] climate change due to sea ice decline, especially in their northern wintering grounds such as the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait regions. Satellite data collected from these areas shows the amount of sea ice has been markedly reduced from what it was previously. It is thought that narwhals' foraging ranges reflect patterns they acquired early in life, which improves their capacity to obtain the food supplies they need for the winter. This strategy focuses on strong [site fidelity] site fidelity rather than individual-level responses to local prey distribution, resulting in focal foraging areas during the winter. As such, despite changing conditions, narwhals will continue to return to the same areas during migration. 
Reduction in sea ice has possibly led to increased exposure to predation. In 2002, hunters in [Siorapaluk] Siorapaluk experienced an increase in the number of caught narwhals, but this increase did not seem to be linked to enhanced endeavour, implying that climate change may be making the narwhal more vulnerable to hunting. Scientists recommend assessing population numbers, assigning sustainable [quotas] quotas , and ensuring local acceptance of sustainable development. [Seismic surveys] Seismic surveys associated with [oil exploration] oil exploration disrupt the narwhal's normal migration patterns. These disturbed migrations may also be associated with increased sea ice entrapment. 
== Relationship with humans ==
Narwhals have coexisted alongside [circumpolar peoples] circumpolar peoples for millennia. Their long, distinctive tusks were often held with fascination throughout human history. These tusks were prized for their supposed healing powers, and were worn on staffs and thrones. Depictions of narwhals in paintings such as The Lady and the Unicorn [The Lady and the Unicorn] The Lady and the Unicorn have found a prevalent place in [human arts] human arts . 
=== Inuit ===
Narwhals have been hunted by [Inuit] Inuit to the same extent as other sea mammals, such as [seals] seals and [whales] whales . Almost all parts of the narwhal—the meat, skin, blubber and organs—are consumed. Muktuk Muktuk Muktuk , the raw skin and attached blubber, is considered a delicacy. As a custom, one or two vertebrae per animal are used for tools and [art] art . The skin is an important source of [vitamin C] vitamin C , which is otherwise difficult to obtain in the Arctic Circle. In some places in Greenland, such as [Qaanaaq] Qaanaaq , traditional hunting methods are used and whales are [harpooned] harpooned from handmade [kayaks] kayaks . In other parts of Greenland and Northern Canada, [high-speed boats] high-speed boats and [hunting rifles] hunting rifles are used. 
In [Inuit legend] Inuit legend , the narwhal's tusk was created when a woman with harpoon rope tied around her waist was dragged into the ocean after the harpoon had stuck into a large narwhal. She was then [transformed] transformed into a narwhal; her hair, which she was wearing in a [twisted knot] twisted knot , became the spiralling narwhal tusk. 
=== Tusk trade ===
The narwhal tusk has been highly sought-after in Europe for centuries. This stems from a medieval belief that narwhal tusks were the [horns] horns of the legendary [unicorn] unicorn . According to some theories, [Vikings] Vikings and [Greenland Norse] Greenland Norse began trade of narwhal tusks, which, via European channels, would later reach markets in the [Middle East] Middle East and [East Asia] East Asia . The idea that [Norsemen] Norsemen hunted narwhals was once held, but was never confirmed and is now considered improbable. 
Across medieval Europe, narwhal tusks were given as state gifts to kings and queens. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the price tag of tusks was said to be a couple of hundred times greater than its weight in [gold] gold .  [Ivan the Terrible] Ivan the Terrible had a jewellery-covered narwhal tusk on his deathbed, while [Elizabeth I] Elizabeth I received a narwhal tusk allegedly valued at £10,000 [pounds sterling] pounds sterling from the [privateer] privateer  [Martin Frobisher] Martin Frobisher ; both items were staples in [cabinets of curiosities] cabinets of curiosities . 
Considered to have magical properties, narwhal tusks were used to counter poisoning, and all sorts of diseases such as [measles] measles and [rubella] rubella . The rise of science towards the end of the 17th century led to a decreased belief in [magic] magic and [alchemy] alchemy . After the unicorn notion was scientifically refuted, narwhal tusks were rarely employed for magical purposes.

Pangolin,Pangolin,"
Pangolins Pangolins , sometimes known as scaly anteaters scaly anteaters , are [mammals] mammals of the order Pholidota Pholidota ( [/fɒlɪˈdoʊtə/] / f f ɒ ɒ l l ɪ ɪ ˈ ˈ d d oʊ oʊ t t ə ə / ). The one [extant] extant family, the [Manidae] Manidae , has three genera: Manis [Manis] Manis , Phataginus [Phataginus] Phataginus , and Smutsia [Smutsia] Smutsia .  Manis Manis comprises four species found in Asia, while Phataginus Phataginus and Smutsia Smutsia include two species each, all found in sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). Several [extinct] extinct pangolin species are also known. In September 2023, nine species were reported. 
Pangolins have large, protective [keratin] keratin scales, similar in material to fingernails and toenails, covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. Depending on the species, they live in hollow trees or [burrows] burrows . Pangolins are [nocturnal] nocturnal , and their diet consists of mainly [ants] ants and [termites] termites , which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years. Pangolins superficially resemble [armadillos] armadillos , though the two are not closely related; they have merely undergone [convergent evolution] convergent evolution .
Pangolins are [threatened by poaching] threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in [traditional medicine] traditional medicine ) and heavy [deforestation] deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most [trafficked] trafficked mammals in the world. As of January 2020 , there are eight species of pangolin whose [conservation status] conservation status is listed in the [threatened] threatened tier. Three ( Manis culionensis [Manis culionensis] Manis culionensis , M. pentadactyla [M. pentadactyla] M. pentadactyla and M. javanica [M. javanica] M. javanica ) are critically endangered, three ( Phataginus tricuspis [Phataginus tricuspis] Phataginus tricuspis , Manis crassicaudata [Manis crassicaudata] Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea [Smutsia gigantea] Smutsia gigantea ) are endangered and two ( Phataginus tetradactyla [Phataginus tetradactyla] Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii [Smutsia temminckii] Smutsia temminckii ) are vulnerable on the [Red List of Threatened Species] Red List of Threatened Species of the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature . 
== Etymology ==
The name of order Pholidota comes from [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek  [ϕολιδωτός] ϕολιδωτός – ""clad in scales"" from φολίς φολίς φολίς  pholís pholís "" [scale] scale "". 
The name ""pangolin"" comes from the [Malay] Malay word pengguling pengguling meaning ""one who rolls up"" from guling guling or giling giling ""to roll""; it was used for the [Sunda pangolin] Sunda pangolin ( Manis javanica Manis javanica ). However, the modern name is tenggiling tenggiling . In [Javanese] Javanese ,  it is terenggiling terenggiling ; and in the [Philippine languages] Philippine languages , it is goling goling , tanggiling tanggiling , or balintong balintong (with the same meaning). 
In ancient India, according to [Aelian] Aelian , it was known as the phattáges phattáges (φαττάγης). 
== Description ==
The physical appearance of a pangolin is marked by large, hardened, overlapping, plate-like scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal matures. They are made of [keratin] keratin , the same material from which human [fingernails] fingernails and [tetrapod] tetrapod  [claws] claws are made, and are structurally and compositionally very different from the scales of reptiles. The pangolin's scaled body is comparable in appearance to a [pine cone] pine cone . It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as [armor] armor , while it protects its face by tucking it under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing extra defense from predators. 
Pangolins can emit a noxious-smelling chemical from [glands] glands near the anus, similar to the spray of a [skunk] skunk . They have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing into [ant] ant and [termite] termite mounds and for climbing. 
The tongues of pangolins are extremely long, and like those of the [giant anteater] giant anteater and the [tube-lipped nectar bat] tube-lipped nectar bat , the root of the tongue is not attached to the [hyoid] hyoid bone but is in the [thorax] thorax between the [sternum] sternum and the [trachea] trachea . Large pangolins can extend their tongues as much as 40 cm (16 in), with a diameter of only about .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 0.5 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 5 5 in). 
== Behaviour ==
Most pangolins are [nocturnal] nocturnal animals which use their well-developed sense of smell to find insects. The [long-tailed pangolin] long-tailed pangolin is also active by day, while other species of pangolins spend most of the daytime sleeping, curled up into a ball ("" [volvation] volvation ""). 
[Arboreal] Arboreal pangolins live in hollow trees, whereas the ground-dwelling species dig tunnels to a depth of 3.5 m (11 ft). 
Some pangolins walk with their front claws bent under the foot pad, although they use the entire foot pad on their rear limbs. Furthermore, some exhibit a [bipedal] bipedal stance for some behavior, and may walk a few steps bipedally. Pangolins are also good swimmers. 
=== Diet ===
Pangolins are [insectivorous] insectivorous . Most of their diet consists of various species of ants and termites and may be supplemented by other insects, especially larvae. They are somewhat particular and tend to consume only one or two species of insects, even when many species are available. A pangolin can consume 140 to 200 g (5 to 7 oz) of insects per day. Pangolins are an important regulator of termite populations in their natural habitats. 
Pangolins have very poor [vision] vision . They also lack teeth. They rely heavily on [smell] smell and [hearing] hearing , and they have other physical characteristics to help them eat ants and termites. Their skeletal structure is sturdy and they have strong front legs used for tearing into termite mounds. They use their powerful front claws to dig into trees, soil, and vegetation to find prey, then proceed to use their long tongues to probe inside the insect tunnels and to retrieve their prey.
The structure of their tongue and stomach is key to aiding pangolins in obtaining and digesting insects. Their [saliva] saliva is sticky, causing ants and termites to stick to their long tongues when they are hunting through insect tunnels. Without teeth, pangolins cannot also chew; but while [foraging] foraging , they ingest small stones ( [gastroliths] gastroliths ), which accumulate in their stomachs to help to grind up ants. This part of their stomach is called the [gizzard] gizzard , and it is also covered in keratinous spines. These spines further aid in the grinding up and digestion of the pangolin's prey.
Some species, such as the [tree pangolin] tree pangolin , use their strong, [prehensile] prehensile tails to hang from tree branches and strip away bark from the trunk, exposing insect nests inside. 
=== Reproduction ===
Pangolins are solitary and meet only to have sex, with mating typically taking place at night after the male and female pangolin meet near a watering hole. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 40% more. While the mating season is not defined, they typically mate once each year, usually during the summer or autumn. Rather than the males seeking out the females, males [mark their location with urine or feces] mark their location with urine or feces and the females find them. If competition over a female occurs, the males use their tails as clubs to fight for the opportunity to mate with her. 
[Gestation] Gestation periods differ by species, ranging from roughly 70 to 140 days. African pangolin females usually give birth to a single offspring at a time, but the Asiatic species may give birth to from one to three. Weight at birth is 80 to 450 g ( 2 + + 3 3 ⁄ 4 4 to 15 + + 3 3 ⁄ 4 4 oz), and the average length is 150 mm (6 in). At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although, in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first two to four weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. [Weaning] Weaning takes place around three months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At two years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother. 
== Classification and phylogeny ==
=== Taxonomy ===
=== Phylogeny ===
The order Pholidota was long considered to be the [sister taxon] sister taxon to [Xenarthra] Xenarthra (neotropical [anteaters] anteaters , [sloths] sloths , and [armadillos] armadillos ), but recent genetic evidence indicates their closest living relatives are the [carnivorans] carnivorans , with which they form a [clade] clade , the [Ferae] Ferae .  [Palaeanodonts] Palaeanodonts are even closer relatives to pangolins, being classified with pangolins in the clade [Pholidotamorpha] Pholidotamorpha . The split between carnivorans and pangolins is estimated to have occurred 79.47 [Ma] Ma (million years) ago. 
The first dichotomy in the [phylogeny] phylogeny of extant Manidae separates Asian pangolins ( Manis Manis ) from African pangolins ( Smutsia Smutsia and Phataginus Phataginus ). Within the former, Manis pentadactyla Manis pentadactyla is the [sister group] sister group to a clade comprising M. crassicaudata M. crassicaudata and M. javanica M. javanica . Within the latter, a split separates the large terrestrial African pangolins of the genus Smutsia Smutsia from the small arboreal African pangolins of the genus Phataginus Phataginus . 
Asian and African pangolins are thought to have diverged about 41.37 Ma ago. Moreover, the [basal] basal position of Manis Manis within Pholidota suggests the group originated in Eurasia, consistent with their [laurasiatherian] laurasiatherian phylogeny. 
== Threats ==
Pangolins are in high demand in southern China and [Vietnam] Vietnam because their scales are believed to have medicinal properties in [traditional Chinese] traditional Chinese and [Vietnamese medicine] Vietnamese medicine . Their meat is also considered a delicacy. 100,000 are estimated to be trafficked a year to China and Vietnam, amounting to over one million over the past decade. This makes them the most [trafficked animal] trafficked animal in the world. This, coupled with [deforestation] deforestation , has led to a large decrease in the numbers of pangolins. Some species, such as Manis pentadactyla [Manis pentadactyla] Manis pentadactyla have become commercially extinct in certain ranges as a result of overhunting. In November 2010, pangolins were added to the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London 's list of evolutionarily distinct and endangered mammals. All eight species of pangolin are assessed as threatened by the [IUCN] IUCN , while three are classified as [critically endangered] critically endangered . All pangolin species are currently listed under Appendix I of [CITES] CITES which prohibits international trade, except when the product is intended for non-commercial purposes and a permit has been granted. 
China had been the main destination country for pangolins until 2018, where it was surpassed by Vietnam. In 2019, Vietnam was reported to have seized the largest volumes of pangolin scales, surpassing Nigeria that year. 
Pangolins are also hunted and eaten in Ghana and are one of the more popular types of [bushmeat] bushmeat , while local healers use the pangolin as a source of traditional medicine. 
Though pangolins are protected by an international ban on their trade, populations have suffered from illegal trafficking due to beliefs in East Asia that their ground-up scales can stimulate [lactation] lactation or cure cancer or [asthma] asthma . In the past decade, numerous seizures of illegally trafficked pangolin and pangolin meat have taken place in Asia. In one such incident in April 2013, 10,000 kg (22,000 pounds) of pangolin meat were seized from a Chinese vessel that ran aground in the [Philippines] Philippines . In another case in August 2016, an Indonesian man was arrested after police raided his home and found over 650 pangolins in freezers on his property. The same threat is reported in [Nigeria] Nigeria , where the animal is on the verge of extinction due to [overexploitation] overexploitation . The overexploitation comes from hunting pangolins for game meat and the reduction of their forest habitats due to deforestation caused by [timber harvesting] timber harvesting . The pangolin are hunted as game meat for both medicinal purposes and food consumption. 
== Virology ==
=== COVID-19 infection ===
The [nucleic acid sequence] nucleic acid sequence of a specific receptor-binding domain of the [spike protein] spike protein belonging to [coronaviruses] coronaviruses taken from pangolins was found to be a 99% match with SARS coronavirus 2 ( [SARS-CoV-2] SARS-CoV-2 ), the virus which causes [COVID-19] COVID-19 and is responsible for the [COVID-19 pandemic] COVID-19 pandemic . Researchers in [Guangzhou] Guangzhou , China, hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 had originated in bats, and prior to infecting humans, was circulating among pangolins. The illicit Chinese trade of pangolins for use in [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine was suggested as a [vector] vector for human transmission. However, whole-genome comparison found that the pangolin and human [coronaviruses] coronaviruses share only up to 92% of their RNA. Ecologists worried that the early speculation about pangolins being the source may have led to mass slaughters, endangering them further, which was similar to what happened to [Asian palm civets] Asian palm civets during the [SARS] SARS outbreak. It was later proved that the testing which suggested that pangolins were a potential host for the virus was flawed, when [genetic analysis] genetic analysis showed that the [spike protein] spike protein and its binding to receptors in pangolins had minimal effect from the virus, and therefore were not likely mechanisms for COVID-19 infections in humans. 
=== PestivirusandColtivirus ===
In 2020, two novel RNA viruses distantly related to [pestiviruses] pestiviruses and [coltiviruses] coltiviruses have been detected in the genomes of dead Manis javanica Manis javanica and Manis pentadactyla Manis pentadactyla . To refer to both sampling site and hosts, they were named Dongyang pangolin virus (DYPV) and Lishui pangolin virus (LSPV). The DYPV pestivirus was also identified in Amblyomma javanense [Amblyomma javanense] Amblyomma javanense nymph [ticks] ticks from a diseased pangolin. 
== Folk medicine ==
Pangolin scales and flesh are used as ingredients for various [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine preparations. While no [scientific evidence] scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of those practices, and they have no logical [mechanism of action] mechanism of action , their popularity still drives the [black market] black market for animal body parts, despite concerns about toxicity, transmission of diseases from animals to humans, and species extermination. The ongoing demand for parts as ingredients continues to fuel [pangolin poaching, hunting and trading] pangolin poaching, hunting and trading . 
The first record of pangolin scales occurs in Ben Cao Jinji Zhu Ben Cao Jinji Zhu (""Variorum of Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica"", 500 CE), which recommends pangolin scales for protection against ant bites; burning the scales as a cure for people crying hysterically during the night. During the [Tang dynasty] Tang dynasty , a recipe for expelling evil spirits with a formulation of scales, herbs, and minerals appeared in 682, and in 752 CE the idea that pangolin scales could also stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, one of the main uses today, was recommended in the Wai Tai Mi Yao Wai Tai Mi Yao (""Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library""). In the [Song dynasty] Song dynasty , the notion of penetrating and clearing blockages was emphasized in the Taiping sheng hui fan Taiping sheng hui fan (""Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled During the Era of Peace and Tranquility""), compiled by Wang Huaiyin in 992. 
In the 21st century, the main uses of pangolin scales are [quackery] quackery practices based on unproven claims the scales dissolve [blood clots] blood clots , promote blood circulation, or help [lactating women] lactating women secrete milk. The supposed health effects of pangolin meat and scales claimed by [folk medicine] folk medicine practitioners are based on their consumption of ants, long tongues, and protective scales. 
The official [pharmacopoeia] pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China included Chinese pangolin scales as an ingredient in TCM formulations. Pangolins were removed from the pharmacopoeia starting from the first half of 2020. Although pangolin scales have been removed from the list of raw ingredients, the scales are still listed as a key ingredient in various medicines. 
Pangolin parts are also used for medicinal purposes in other Asian countries such as India, Nepal and Pakistan. In some parts of India and Nepal, locals believe that wearing the scales of a pangolin can help prevent pneumonia. Pangolin scales have also been used for medicinal purposes in Malaysia, Indonesia and northern Myanmar. Indigenous people in southern [Palawan] Palawan , Philippines, have held the belief that elders could avoid prostate illnesses by wearing belts made with the scales. 
== Conservation ==
As a result of increasing threats to pangolins, mainly in the form of illegal, international trade in pangolin skin, scales, and meat, these species have received increasing conservation attention in recent years. As of January 2020 , the IUCN considered all eight species of pangolin on its [Red List of Threatened Species] Red List of Threatened Species as threatened. The IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group launched a global action plan to conserve pangolins, dubbed ""Scaling up Pangolin Conservation"", in July 2014. This action plan aims to improve all aspects of pangolin conservation with an added emphasis on combating poaching and [trafficking] trafficking of the animal while educating communities on its importance. Another suggested approach to fighting pangolin (and general wildlife) trafficking consists in ""following the money"" rather than ""the animal"", which aims to disrupt smugglers' profits by interrupting money flows. Financial intelligence gathering could thus become a key tool in protecting these animals, although this opportunity is often overlooked. In 2018, a Chinese NGO launched the Counting Pangolins movement, calling for joint efforts to save the mammals from trafficking. Wildlife conservation group [TRAFFIC] TRAFFIC has identified 159 smuggling routes used by pangolin traffickers and aims to shut these down. 
Many attempts have been made to breed pangolins in captivity, but due to their reliance on wide-ranging habitats and very particular diets, these attempts are often unsuccessful. Pangolins have significantly decreased immune responses due to a genetic dysfunction, making them extremely fragile. They are susceptible to diseases such as [pneumonia] pneumonia and the development of [ulcers] ulcers in captivity, complications that can lead to an early death. In addition, pangolins rescued from illegal trade often have a higher chance of being infected with parasites such as [intestinal worms] intestinal worms , further lessening their chance for rehabilitation and reintroduction to the wild. 
The idea of farming pangolins to reduce the number being illegally trafficked is being explored with little success. The third Saturday in February is promoted as World Pangolin Day by the conservation NPO Annamiticus. World Pangolin Day has been noted for its effectiveness in generating awareness about pangolins. 
In 2017, [Jackie Chan] Jackie Chan made a public service announcement called [WildAid] WildAid : Jackie Chan & Pangolins (Kung Fu Pangolin) . 
In December 2020, a study found that it is ""not too late"" to establish conservation efforts for Philippine pangolins ( Manis culionensis Manis culionensis ), a species that is only found on the island province of Palawan. 
=== Taiwan ===
[Taiwan] Taiwan is one of the few conservation grounds for pangolins in the world after the country enacted the 1989 Wildlife Conservation Act. The introduction of Wildlife Rehabilitation Centers in places like Luanshan ( [Yanping Township] Yanping Township ) in [Taitung] Taitung and [Xiulin] Xiulin townships in [Hualien] Hualien became important communities for protecting pangolins and their habitats and has greatly improved the survival of pangolins. These centers work with local aboriginal tribes and forest police in the National Police Agency to prevent poaching, trafficking, and smuggling of pangolins, especially to black markets in China. These centers have also helped to reveal the causes of death and injury among Taiwan's pangolin population. Today, Taiwan has the highest population density of pangolins in the world.

Dugong,Dugong,"
The dugong dugong ( [/ˈd(j)uːɡɒŋ/] / ˈ ˈ d d ( j j j ) uː uː ɡ ɡ ɒ ɒ ŋ ŋ / ; Dugong dugon Dugong dugon Dugong dugon ) is a [marine mammal] marine mammal . It is one of four living species of the order [Sirenia] Sirenia , which also includes three species of [manatees] manatees . It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family [Dugongidae] Dugongidae ; its closest modern relative, [Steller's sea cow] Steller's sea cow ( Hydrodamalis gigas Hydrodamalis gigas ), was hunted to [extinction] extinction in the 18th century.
The dugong is the only sirenian in its range, which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the [Indo-West Pacific] Indo-West Pacific . The dugong is largely dependent on [seagrass] seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats that support [seagrass meadows] seagrass meadows , with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide, shallow, protected areas such as [bays] bays , [mangrove] mangrove  [channels] channels , the waters of large [inshore] inshore islands and inter-reefal waters. The northern waters of Australia between [Shark Bay] Shark Bay and [Moreton Bay] Moreton Bay are believed to be the dugong's contemporary stronghold.
Like all modern sirenians, the dugong has a [fusiform] fusiform body with no [dorsal fin] dorsal fin or [hind limbs] hind limbs . The [forelimbs] forelimbs or flippers are paddle-like. The dugong is easily distinguishable from the manatees by its fluked, dolphin-like tail; moreover, it possesses a unique skull and teeth. Its [snout] snout is sharply downturned, an adaptation for feeding in [benthic] benthic seagrass communities. The molar teeth are simple and peg-like, unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees.
The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its [meat] meat and [oil] oil . Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range, particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. The dugong's current distribution is fragmented, and many populations are believed to be close to extinction. The [IUCN] IUCN lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction, while the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species limits or bans the trade of derived products. Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain [anthropogenic] anthropogenic and include fishing-related fatalities, habitat degradation, and hunting. With its long lifespan of 70 years or more and slow rate of reproduction, the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction.
== Evolution ==
Dugongs are part of the [Sirenia] Sirenia  [order] order of [placental mammals] placental mammals which comprises modern ""sea cows"" ( [manatees] manatees as well as dugongs) and their extinct relatives. Sirenia are the only extant [herbivorous] herbivorous  [marine mammals] marine mammals and the only group of herbivorous mammals to have become completely aquatic. Sirenians are thought to have a 50-million-year-old [fossil] fossil record (early [Eocene] Eocene -recent). They attained modest diversity during the [Oligocene] Oligocene and [Miocene] Miocene but subsequently declined as a result of climatic cooling, oceanographic changes, and human interference. 
== Etymology and taxonomy ==
The word ""dugong"" derives from the [Visayan] Visayan (probably [Cebuano] Cebuano ) dugung dugung dugung dugung . The name was first adopted and popularized by the [French] French  [naturalist] naturalist  [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon , as "" dugon dugon "" in Histoire Naturelle Histoire Naturelle (1765), after descriptions of the animal from the island of [Leyte] Leyte in the [Philippines] Philippines . The name ultimately derives from [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian] Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *duyuŋ. Despite [common misconception] common misconception , the term does not come from [Malay] Malay  duyung duyung and it does not mean ""lady of the sea"" ( [Mermaid] Mermaid ). 
Other common local names include ""sea cow"", ""sea pig"" and ""sea camel"". It is known as the balguja balguja by the [Wunambal] Wunambal people of the [Mitchell Plateau] Mitchell Plateau area in [the Kimberley] the Kimberley , [Western Australia] Western Australia . 
Dugong dugon Dugong dugon is the only extant species of the family [Dugongidae] Dugongidae , and one of only four extant species of the [Sirenia] Sirenia order, the others forming the [manatee] manatee family. It was first classified by [Müller] Müller in 1776 as Trichechus dugon Trichechus dugon , a member of the manatee genus previously defined by [Linnaeus] Linnaeus . It was later assigned as the [type species] type species of Dugong Dugong by [Lacépède] Lacépède and further classified within its own family by [Gray] Gray and subfamily by [Simpson] Simpson . 
Dugongs and other sirenians are not closely related to other [marine mammals] marine mammals , being more related to [elephants] elephants . Dugongs and elephants share a [monophyletic] monophyletic group with [hyraxes] hyraxes and the [aardvark] aardvark , one of the earliest offshoots of [eutherians] eutherians . The fossil record shows sirenians appearing in the [Eocene] Eocene , where they most likely lived in the [Tethys Ocean] Tethys Ocean . The two extant families of sirenians are thought to have diverged in the mid-Eocene, after which the dugongs and their closest relative, the [Steller's sea cow] Steller's sea cow , split off from a common ancestor in the [Miocene] Miocene . The Steller's sea cow became extinct in the 18th century. No fossils exist of other members of the Dugongidae. 
Molecular studies have been made on dugong populations using [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA . The results have suggested that the population of [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia is distinct from the others. Australia has two distinct maternal lineages, one of which also contains the dugongs from Africa and Arabia. Limited genetic mixing has taken place between those in Southeast Asia and those in Australia, mostly around [Timor] Timor . One of the lineages stretches from [Moreton Bay] Moreton Bay to [Western Australia] Western Australia , while the other only stretches from Moreton Bay to the [Northern Territory] Northern Territory . There is not yet sufficient genetic data to make clear boundaries between distinct groups. 
== Anatomy and morphology ==
The dugong's body is large with a [cylindrical] cylindrical shape that tapers at both ends. It has thick, smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth, but darkens [dorsally] dorsally and laterally to brownish-to-dark-grey with age. The colour of a dugong can change due to the growth of [algae] algae on the skin. The body is sparsely covered in short hair, a common feature among sirenians which may allow for [tactile] tactile interpretation of their environment. These hairs are most developed around the mouth, which has a large [horseshoe-shaped] horseshoe-shaped upper lip forming a highly mobile muzzle. This muscular upper lip aids the dugong in [foraging] foraging . 
The dugong's [tail flukes] tail flukes and flippers are similar to those of [dolphins] dolphins . These flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. The dugong lacks [nails] nails on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugong's body length. The tail has deep notches. 
A dugong's brain weighs a maximum of 300 g (11 oz), about 0.1% of the animal's body weight. With very small eyes, dugongs have limited vision, but acute hearing within narrow sound thresholds. Their ears, which lack [pinnae] pinnae , are located on the sides of their head. The nostrils are located on top of the head and can be closed using valves. Dugongs have two [teats] teats , one located behind each flipper. There are few differences between the sexes; the body structures are almost the same. A male's [testes] testes are not externally located, and the main difference between males and females is the location of the [genital] genital aperture to the [umbilicus] umbilicus and the [anus] anus . The [lungs] lungs in a dugong are very long, extending almost as far as the [kidneys] kidneys , which are also highly elongated to cope with the saltwater environment. If the dugong is wounded, its blood will [clot] clot rapidly. 
The [skull] skull of a dugong is unique. The skull is enlarged with a sharply down-turned [premaxilla] premaxilla , which is stronger in males. The spine has between 57 and 60 [vertebrae] vertebrae . Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two [incisors] incisors ( [tusks] tusks ) which emerge in males during puberty. The female's tusks continue to grow without emerging during puberty, sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the [premaxilla] premaxilla . The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong, and the cheek teeth move forward with age. 
The full [dental formula] dental formula of dugongs is 2.0.3.3 2.0.3.3 3.1.3.3 3.1.3.3 , meaning they have two incisors, three [premolars] premolars , and three molars on each side of their upper jaw, and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars on each side of their lower jaw. Like other sirenians, the dugong experiences [pachyostosis] pachyostosis , a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are unusually solid and contain little or no [marrow] marrow . These heavy bones, which are among the densest in the [animal kingdom] animal kingdom , may act as a [ballast] ballast to help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the water's surface. 
An adult's length rarely exceeds 3 metres (10 ft). An individual this long is expected to weigh around 420 kilograms (930 lb). Weight in adults is typically more than 250 kilograms (550 lb) and less than 900 kilograms (1,980 lb). The largest individual recorded was 4.06 metres (13 ft 4 in) long and weighed 1,016 kilograms (2,240 lb), and was found off the [Saurashtra] Saurashtra coast of west [India] India . Females tend to be larger than males. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Dugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western Pacific Ocean to the eastern coast of Africa, along an estimated 140,000 kilometres (87,000 mi) of coastline between 26° and 27° to the north and south of the [equator] equator . Their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrasses from the [Potamogetonaceae] Potamogetonaceae and [Hydrocharitaceae] Hydrocharitaceae families. The full size of the former range is unknown, although it is believed that the current populations represent the historical limits of the range, which is highly fractured. Their distributions during warmer periods of [Holocene] Holocene might have been broader than today. Today populations of dugongs are found in the waters of 37 countries and territories. Recorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers, due to a lack of accurate surveys. Despite this, the dugong population is thought to be shrinking, with a worldwide decline of 20 percent in the last 90 years. They have disappeared from the waters of [Hong Kong] Hong Kong , [Mauritius] Mauritius , and Taiwan, as well as parts of [Cambodia] Cambodia , Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Further disappearances are likely. 
Dugongs are generally found in warm waters around the coast with large numbers concentrated in wide and shallow protected bays. The dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal, as all species of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree. Nonetheless, they can tolerate the [brackish waters] brackish waters found in coastal wetlands, and large numbers are also found in wide and shallow mangrove [channels] channels and around [leeward] leeward sides of large inshore islands, where seagrass beds are common. They are usually located at a depth of around 10 m (33 ft), although in areas where the continental shelf remains shallow dugongs have been known to travel more than ten kilometres (6 mi) from the shore, descending to as far as 37 metres (121 ft), where deepwater [seagrasses] seagrasses such as Halophila spinulosa [Halophila spinulosa] Halophila spinulosa are found. Special habitats are used for different activities. It has been observed that shallow waters are used as sites for calving, minimizing the risk of predation. Deep waters may provide a thermal refuge from cooler waters closer to the shore during winter. 
=== Australia ===
[Australia] Australia is home to the largest population, stretching from [Shark Bay] Shark Bay in Western Australia to [Moreton Bay] Moreton Bay in [Queensland] Queensland . The population of Shark Bay is thought to be stable with over 10,000 dugongs. Smaller populations exist up the coast, including one in [Ashmore Reef] Ashmore Reef . Large numbers of dugongs live to the north of the [Northern Territory] Northern Territory , with a population of over 20,000 in the [Gulf of Carpentaria] Gulf of Carpentaria alone. A population of over 25,000 exists in the [Torres Strait] Torres Strait such as off [Thursday Island] Thursday Island , although there is significant migration between the strait and the waters of [New Guinea] New Guinea . 
The [Great Barrier Reef] Great Barrier Reef provides important feeding areas for the species; this reef area houses a stable population of around 10,000, although the population concentration has shifted over time. Large bays facing north on the [Queensland] Queensland coast provide significant habitats for dugong, with the southernmost of these being [Hervey Bay] Hervey Bay and Moreton Bay. Dugongs had been occasional visitors along the [Gold Coast] Gold Coast where a re-establishment of a local population through range expansions has started recently. 
=== Persian Gulf ===
The [Persian Gulf] Persian Gulf has the second-largest dugong population in the world, inhabiting most of the southern coast, and the current population is believed to range from 5,800 to 7,300. In the course of a study carried out in 1986 and 1999 on the Persian Gulf, the largest reported group sighting was made of more than 600 individuals to the west of [Qatar] Qatar . A 2017 study found a nearly 25% drop in population since 1950. Reasons for this drastic population loss include illegal poaching, [oil spills] oil spills , and net entanglement. 
=== East Africa and South Asia ===
In the late 1960s, herds of up to 500 dugongs were observed off the coast of [East Africa] East Africa and nearby islands. Current populations in this area are extremely small, numbering 50 and below, and it is thought likely they will become extinct. The eastern side of the [Red Sea] Red Sea is home to large populations numbering in the hundreds, and similar populations are thought to exist on the western side. In the 1980s, it was estimated there could be as many as 4,000 dugongs in the Red Sea. Dugong populations in [Madagascar] Madagascar are poorly studied, but due to widespread exploitation, it is thought they may have severely declined, with few surviving individuals. The resident population around [Mayotte] Mayotte is thought to number just 10 individuals. In [Mozambique] Mozambique , most of the remaining local populations are very small and the largest (about 120 individuals) occurs at [Bazaruto Island] Bazaruto Island , but they have become rare in historical habitats such as in [Maputo Bay] Maputo Bay and on [Inhaca Island] Inhaca Island . The Bazaruto Island population is possibly the last long-term viable population in East Africa, with only some of its core territory lying within protected waters. 
The East African population is genetically distinct from those of the Red Sea and those off Madagascar. In [Tanzania] Tanzania , observations have recently increased around the [Mafia Island Marine Park] Mafia Island Marine Park where a hunt was intended by fishermen but failed in 2009. In the [Seychelles] Seychelles , dugongs had been regarded as extinct in the 18th century until a small number was discovered around the [Aldabra Atoll] Aldabra Atoll . This population may belong to a different group than that distributed among the inner isles. Dugongs once thrived among the [Chagos Archipelago] Chagos Archipelago and [Sea Cow Island] Sea Cow Island was named after the species, although the species no longer occurs in the region. 
There are less than 250 individuals scattered throughout Indian waters. A highly isolated breeding population exists in the [Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch] Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch , the only remaining population in western India. It is 1,500 kilometres (800 nautical miles) from the population in the Persian Gulf, and 1,700 kilometres (900 nmi) from the nearest population in India. Former populations in this area, centered on the [Maldives] Maldives and the [Lakshadweep] Lakshadweep , are presumed to be extinct. A population exists in the [Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park] Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and the [Palk Strait] Palk Strait between India and [Sri Lanka] Sri Lanka , but it is seriously depleted. Recoveries of seagrass beds along former ranges of dugongs, such as the [Chilika Lake] Chilika Lake have been confirmed in recent years, raising hopes for re-colorizations of the species. The population around the [Andaman and Nicobar Islands] Andaman and Nicobar Islands is known only from a few records, and although the population was large during British rule, it is now believed to be small and scattered. 
=== Southeast Asia and the West Pacific ===
A small population existed along the southern coast of [China] China , particularly [the Gulf of Tonkin] the Gulf of Tonkin (Beibu Gulf), where efforts were made to protect it, including the establishment of [a seagrass sanctuary for dugong and other endangered marine fauna] a seagrass sanctuary for dugong and other endangered marine fauna ranging in [Guangxi] Guangxi . Despite these efforts, numbers continued to decrease, and in 2007 it was reported that no more dugong could be found on the west coast of the island of [Hainan] Hainan . Historically, dugongs were also present in the southern parts of the [Yellow Sea] Yellow Sea . The last confirmed record of dugongs in Chinese waters was documented in 2008. In August 2022, an article published on [the Royal Society Open Science] the Royal Society Open Science concluded that dugongs were [functionally extinct] functionally extinct in China, which was based on a large-scale interview survey conducted across four southern Chinese maritime provinces ( [Hainan] Hainan , [Guangxi] Guangxi , [Guangdong] Guangdong , and [Fujian] Fujian ) in the summer of 2019. 
In Vietnam, dugongs have been restricted mostly to the provinces of [Kiên Giang] Kiên Giang and [Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu] Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu , including [Phu Quoc Island] Phu Quoc Island and [Con Dao Island] Con Dao Island , which hosted large populations in the past. Con Dao is now the only site in Vietnam where dugongs are regularly seen, protected within the [Côn Đảo National Park] Côn Đảo National Park . Nonetheless, dangerously low levels of attention to the conservation of marine organisms in Vietnam and Cambodia may result in increased intentional or unintentional catches, and illegal trade is a potential danger for local dugongs. On Phu Quoc, the first 'Dugong Festival' was held in 2014, aiming to raise awareness of these issues. 
In Thailand, the present distribution of dugongs is restricted to six provinces along the [Andaman Sea] Andaman Sea , and very few dugongs are present in the [Gulf of Thailand] Gulf of Thailand . The Gulf of Thailand was historically home to a large number of animals, but none have been sighted in the west of the gulf in recent years, and the remaining population in the east is thought to be very small and possibly declining. Dugongs are believed to exist in the [Straits of Johor] Straits of Johor in very small numbers. The waters around [Borneo] Borneo support a small population, with more scattered throughout the [Malay Archipelago] Malay Archipelago . 
All the islands of the Philippines once provided habitats for sizeable herds of dugongs. They were common until the 1970s when their numbers declined sharply due to accidental drownings in fishing gear and habitat destruction of seagrass meadows. Today, only isolated populations survive, most notably in the waters of the [Calamian Islands] Calamian Islands in [Palawan] Palawan , [Isabela] Isabela in [Luzon] Luzon , [Guimaras] Guimaras , and [Mindanao] Mindanao . The dugong became the first marine animal protected by Philippine law, with harsh penalties for harming them. Recently, the local marine trash problem in the archipelago remained unabated and became the biggest threat to the already dwindling population of Dugongs in the country. Litters of plastic waste (single-use sachets, [plastic bottles] plastic bottles , [fast food] fast food to-go containers, etc.) and other non-biodegradable materials abound in the coastal areas. As these materials may be mistaken as food by dugongs, these may lead to death due to plastic ingestion. Overpopulation and lack of education of all coastal fisherfolk in the Philippines regarding marine trash are harming the coastal environment not only in [Palawan] Palawan but also across the islands of the [Philippines] Philippines . The first documented sighting in [Sarangani Bay] Sarangani Bay occurred in July 2024. 
Populations also exist around the [Solomon Islands] Solomon Islands and [New Caledonia] New Caledonia , stretching to an easternmost population in [Vanuatu] Vanuatu . A highly isolated population lives around the islands of [Palau] Palau . 
A single dugong lives at [Cocos (Keeling) Islands] Cocos (Keeling) Islands although the animal is thought to be a vagrant. 
=== Northern Pacific ===
Today, possibly the smallest and northernmost population of dugongs exists around the [Ryukyu] Ryukyu islands, and a population formerly existed off Taiwan. An endangered population of 50 or fewer dugongs, possibly as few as three individuals, survives around [Okinawa] Okinawa . New sightings of a cow and calf have been reported in 2017, indicating a possible breeding had occurred in these waters. A single individual was recorded at [Amami Ōshima] Amami Ōshima , at the northernmost edge of the dugong's historic range, more than 40 years after the last previous recorded sighting. A vagrant strayed into a port near Ushibuka, Kumamoto, and died due to poor health. Historically, the [Yaeyama Islands] Yaeyama Islands held a large concentration of dugongs, with more than 300 individuals. On the [Aragusuku Islands] Aragusuku Islands , large quantities of skulls are preserved at a [utaki] utaki that outsiders are strictly forbidden to enter. Dugong populations in these areas were reduced by historical hunts as payments to the [Ryukyu Kingdom] Ryukyu Kingdom , before being wiped out because of large-scale illegal hunting and fishing using destructive methods such as [dynamite fishing] dynamite fishing after the Second World War.
Populations around Taiwan appear to be almost extinct, although remnant individuals may visit areas with rich seagrass beds such as [Dongsha Atoll] Dongsha Atoll . Some of the last reported sightings were made in [Kenting National Park] Kenting National Park in the 1950s and 60s. There had been occasional records of vagrants at the [Northern Mariana Islands] Northern Mariana Islands before 1985. It is unknown how much mixing there was between these populations historically. Some theorize that populations existed independently, for example, that the Okinawan population was isolated members derived from the migration of a [Philippine] Philippine subspecies. Others postulate that the populations formed part of a super-population where migration between [Ryukyu] Ryukyu , [Taiwan] Taiwan , and the Philippines was common. 
=== Extinct Mediterranean population ===
It has been confirmed that dugongs once inhabited the water of the [Mediterranean] Mediterranean possibly until after the rise of civilizations along the [inland sea] inland sea . This population possibly shared ancestry with the Red Sea population, and the Mediterranean population had never been large due to geographical factors and [climate changes] climate changes . The Mediterranean is the region where the Dugongidae originated in the mid-late [Eocene] Eocene , along with [Caribbean Sea] Caribbean Sea . 
== Ecology and life history ==
Dugongs are long-lived, and the oldest recorded specimen reached age 73. They have few natural predators, although animals such as crocodiles, killer whales, and sharks pose a threat to the young, and a dugong has also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a [stingray] stingray barb. A large number of infections and parasitic diseases affect dugongs. Detected pathogens include [helminths] helminths , [cryptosporidium] cryptosporidium , different types of bacterial infections, and other unidentified parasites. 30% of dugong deaths in [Queensland] Queensland since 1996 are thought to be because of disease. 
Although they are [social animals] social animals , they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations. Gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen, but they last only for a short time. Because they are shy and do not approach humans, little is known about dugong behavior. They can go six minutes without breathing (though about two and a half minutes is more typical), and have been known to rest on their tails to breathe with their heads above water. They can dive to a maximum depth of 39 metres (128 ft); they spend most of their lives no deeper than 10 metres (33 ft). Communication between individuals is through chirps, whistles, barks, and other sounds that echo underwater. Different sounds have been observed with different amplitudes and frequencies, implying different purposes. Visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight and is mainly used for activities such as [lekking] lekking for courtship purposes. Mothers and calves are in almost constant physical contact, and calves have been known to reach out and touch their mothers with their flippers for reassurance. 
Dugongs are [semi-nomadic] semi-nomadic , often traveling long distances in search of food, but staying within a certain range their entire lives. Large numbers often move together from one area to another. It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability. Their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels. Dugong movements mostly occur within a localized area of seagrass beds, and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement. Daily movement is affected by the tides. In areas where there is a large tidal range, dugongs travel with the tide to access shallower feeding areas. In Moreton Bay, dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters. At higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter. Occasionally individual dugongs make long-distance travels over many days and can travel over deep ocean waters. One animal was seen as far south as [Sydney] Sydney . Although they are marine creatures, dugongs have been known to travel up creeks, and in one case a dugong was caught fifteen kilometres (8 nmi) up a creek near [Cooktown] Cooktown . 
=== Feeding ===
Dugongs, along with other [sirenians] sirenians , are referred to as ""sea cows"" because their diet consists mainly of [seagrass] seagrass , particularly the genera Halophila [Halophila] Halophila and Halodule [Halodule] Halodule . When eating they ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves. A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists they will eat [algae] algae when seagrass is scarce. Although almost completely [herbivorous] herbivorous , they will occasionally eat [invertebrates] invertebrates such as [jellyfish] jellyfish , [sea squirts] sea squirts , and [shellfish] shellfish . Dugongs in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as [polychaetes] polychaetes or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases. In other southern areas of both western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. This does not apply to dugongs in tropical areas, in which fecal evidence indicates that invertebrates are not eaten. 
Most dugongs do not feed on lush areas, but where the seagrass is more sparse. Additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed. The chemical structure and composition of the seagrass are important, and the grass species most often eaten are low in fiber, high in nitrogen, and easily digestible. In the Great Barrier Reef, dugongs feed on low-fiber high-nitrogen seagrass such as Halophila [Halophila] Halophila and Halodule [Halodule] Halodule , to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating. Seagrasses of a lower [seral] seral are preferred, where the area has not fully vegetated. Only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption, due to the dugong's highly specialized diet. There is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels. Dugongs may search out deeper seagrass. Feeding trails have been observed as deep as 33 metres (108 ft), and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as 37 metres (121 ft). Dugongs are relatively slow-moving, swimming at around 10 km/h (3 m/s). When moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral fins. 
Dugong feeding may favor the subsequent growth of low-fibre, high-nitrogen seagrasses such as Halophilia Halophilia and Halodule. Halodule. Species such as Zosteria capricorni Zosteria capricorni are more dominant in established seagrass beds, but grow slowly, while Halophilia Halophilia and Halodule Halodule grow quickly in the open space left by dugong feeding. This behavior is known as cultivation grazing and favors the rapidly growing, higher nutrient seagrasses that dugongs prefer. Dugongs may also prefer to feed on younger, less fibrous strands of seagrasses, and cycles of cultivation feeding at different seagrass meadows may provide them with a greater number of younger plants.
Due to their poor eyesight, dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants. They also have a strong [tactile sense] tactile sense and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles. They will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it. They have been known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them. The flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants. This leaves furrows in the sand in their path. 
=== Reproduction and parental care ===
A dugong reaches [sexual maturity] sexual maturity between the ages of eight and eighteen, older than in most other mammals. The way that females know how a male has reached sexual maturity is by the eruption of tusks in the male since tusks erupt in males when testosterone levels reach a high enough level. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, with some studies placing the age between ten and seventeen years, while others place it as early as six years. There is evidence that male dugongs lose [fertility] fertility at older ages. 
Despite the longevity of the dugong, which may live for 50 years or more, females give birth only a few times during their lives and invest considerable parental care in their young. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2.4 to 7 years. 
[Mating behaviour] Mating behaviour varies between populations located in different areas. In some populations, males will establish a territory that females in [estrus] estrus will visit. In these areas, a male will try to impress the females while defending the area from other males, a practice known as [lekking] lekking . In other areas many males will attempt to mate with the same female, sometimes inflicting injuries to the female or each other. During this, the female will have copulated with multiple males, who will have fought to mount her from below. This greatly increases the chances of conception. 
Females give birth after a 13- to 15-month [gestation] gestation , usually to just one calf. Birth occurs in very shallow water, with occasions known where the mothers were almost on the shore. As soon as the young is born the mother pushes it to the surface to take a breath. Newborns are already 1.2 metres (4 ft) long and weigh around 30 kilograms (65 lb). Once born, they stay close to their mothers, possibly to make swimming easier. The calf nurses for 14–18 months, although it begins to eat seagrasses soon after birth. A calf will only leave its mother once it has matured. 
== Importance to humans ==
Dugongs have historically provided easy targets for hunters, who killed them for their meat, oil, skin, and bones. As the anthropologist A. Asbjørn Jøn has noted, they are often considered the inspiration for [mermaids] mermaids , and people around the world developed cultures around dugong hunting. In some areas, it remains an animal of great significance, and a growing ecotourism industry around dugongs has had an economic benefit in some countries. 
There is a 5,000-year-old wall painting of a dugong, apparently drawn by [Neolithic] Neolithic peoples, in [Tambun Cave] Tambun Cave , [Ipoh] Ipoh , Malaysia. This was discovered by Lieutenant R.L. Rawlings in 1959 while on a routine patrol. 
Dugongs feature in Southeast Asian, especially [Austronesian] Austronesian , [folklore] folklore . In languages like [Ilocano] Ilocano , [Mapun] Mapun , [Yakan] Yakan , [Tausug] Tausug , and [Kadazan Dusun] Kadazan Dusun of the [Philippines] Philippines and [Sabah] Sabah , the name for dugongs is a synonym for ""mermaid"". In [Malay] Malay , they are sometimes referred to as perempoen laut perempoen laut (""woman of the sea"") or putri duyong putri duyong (""dugong princess""), leading to the misconception that the word ""dugong"" itself means ""lady of the sea"". A common belief found in the Philippines, [Malaysia] Malaysia , [Indonesia] Indonesia , and [Thailand] Thailand , is that dugongs were originally human or part-human (usually women), and that they cry when they are butchered or [beached] beached . Because of this, it is considered bad luck if a dugong is killed or accidentally dies in nets or [fish corrals] fish corrals in the Philippines, some parts of [Sabah] Sabah (Malaysia), and northern [Sulawesi] Sulawesi and the [Lesser Sunda Islands] Lesser Sunda Islands (Indonesia). Dugongs are predominantly not traditionally hunted for food in these regions and they remained plentiful until around the 1970s. 
Conversely, dugong ""tears"" are considered [aphrodisiacs] aphrodisiacs in other parts of [Indonesia] Indonesia , [Singapore] Singapore , [Malaysia] Malaysia , [Brunei] Brunei , [Thailand] Thailand , [Vietnam] Vietnam , and [Cambodia] Cambodia . Dugong meat is considered a luxury food and is also believed to have aphrodisiac properties. They are actively hunted in these regions, in some places to near-extinction. 
In [Palau] Palau , dugongs were traditionally hunted with heavy spears from canoes. Although it is illegal and there is widespread disapproval of killing dugongs, poaching remains a major problem. Dugongs are also widely hunted in [Papua New Guinea] Papua New Guinea , the [Solomon Islands] Solomon Islands , [Vanuatu] Vanuatu , and [New Caledonia] New Caledonia ; where their meat and ornaments made from bones and tusks are highly prized in feasts and traditional rituals. However, hunting dugongs is considered [taboo] taboo in some areas of Vanuatu. Dugong meat and oil have traditionally been some of the most valuable foods of [Australian Aboriginals] Australian Aboriginals and [Torres Strait Islanders] Torres Strait Islanders . Some Aboriginals regard dugongs as part of their Aboriginality. 
Local fishermen in [Southern China] Southern China traditionally revered dugongs and regarded them as ""miraculous fish"". They believed it was bad luck to catch them and they were plentiful in the region before the 1960s. Beginning in the 1950s, a wave of immigrants from other regions that do not hold these beliefs resulted in dugongs being hunted for food and [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine . This led to a steep decline in dugong populations in the [Gulf of Tonkin] Gulf of Tonkin and the sea around [Hainan Island] Hainan Island . In [Japan] Japan , dugongs have been traditionally hunted in the [Ryukyu Islands] Ryukyu Islands since prehistoric times. Carved ribs of dugongs in the shape of butterflies (a [psychopomp] psychopomp ) are found throughout [Okinawa] Okinawa . They were commonly hunted throughout Japan up until around the 1970s. 
Dugongs have also played a role in legends in Kenya, and the animal is known there as the ""Queen of the Sea"". Body parts are used as food, medicine, and decorations. In the Gulf states, dugongs served not only as a source of food but their tusks were used as sword handles. Dugong oil is important as a preservative and conditioner for wooden boats to people around the [Gulf of Kutch] Gulf of Kutch in India, who also believe the meat to be an [aphrodisiac] aphrodisiac . 
== Conservation ==
Dugong numbers have decreased in recent times. For a population to remain stable, the mortality of adults cannot exceed 5% annually. The estimated percentage of females humans can kill without depleting the population is 1–2%. This number is reduced in areas where [calving] calving is minimal due to food shortages. Even in the best conditions, a population is unlikely to increase more than 5% a year, leaving dugongs vulnerable to over-exploitation. The fact that they live in shallow waters puts them under great pressure from human activity. Research on dugongs and the effects of human activity on them has been limited, mostly taking place in Australia. In many countries, dugong numbers have never been surveyed. As such, trends are uncertain, with more data needed for comprehensive management. The only data stretching back far enough to mention population trends comes from the urban coast of [Queensland, Australia] Queensland, Australia . The last major worldwide study, made in 2002, concluded that the dugong was declining and possibly extinct in a third of its range, with unknown status in another half. 
The [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List lists the dugong as vulnerable, and the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulates and in some areas has banned international trade. Most dugong habitats fall within proposed [important marine mammal areas] important marine mammal areas . Regional cooperation is important due to the widespread distribution of the animal, and in 1998 there was strong support for [Southeast Asian] Southeast Asian cooperation to protect dugongs. [Kenya] Kenya has passed legislation banning the hunting of dugongs and restricting trawling, but the dugong is not yet listed under Kenya's [Wildlife Act] Wildlife Act as an endangered species. [Mozambique] Mozambique has had legislation to protect dugongs since 1955, but this has not been effectively enforced. France has a National Action Plan covering the species, implemented within the [Mayotte Marine Natural Park] Mayotte Marine Natural Park . 
Many marine parks have been established on the African coast of the Red Sea, and the [Egyptian] Egyptian  [Gulf of Aqaba] Gulf of Aqaba is fully protected. The [United Arab Emirates] United Arab Emirates has banned all hunting of dugongs within its waters, as has [Bahrain] Bahrain . The UAE has additionally banned [drift net] drift net fishing, and has declared an intention to restore coastal ecosystems dugongs rely on.  [India] India and [Sri Lanka] Sri Lanka ban the hunting and selling of dugongs and their products. [Japan] Japan has listed dugongs as endangered and has banned intentional killing and harassment. Hunting, catching, and harassment are banned by the [People's Republic of China] People's Republic of China . The first marine mammal to be protected in the Philippines was the dugong, although monitoring this is difficult. [Palau] Palau has legislated to protect dugongs, although this is not well enforced and poaching persists. Indonesia listed dugongs as a protected species in 1999, and in 2018 the Fisheries Ministry began implementing a conservation plan. Protection is not always enforced and souvenir products made from dugong parts can be openly found in markets in Bali. Traditional dugong hunters continued to hunt for many years, and some have struggled to find alternative incomes after ceasing. The dugong is a national animal of [Papua New Guinea] Papua New Guinea , which bans all except traditional hunting. [Vanuatu] Vanuatu and [New Caledonia] New Caledonia ban the hunting of dugongs. Dugongs are protected throughout Australia, although the rules vary by state; in some areas, indigenous hunting is allowed. 
Dugongs are listed under the [Nature Conservation Act] Nature Conservation Act in the Australian state of Queensland as vulnerable. Most currently live in established [marine parks] marine parks , where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted. The [World Wide Fund for Nature] World Wide Fund for Nature has purchased [gillnet] gillnet licences in northern Queensland to reduce the impact of fishing. In [Vietnam] Vietnam , an illegal network targeting dugongs had been detected and was shut down in 2012. Potential hunts along [Tanzanian] Tanzanian coasts by fishermen have raised concerns as well. 
=== Human activity ===
Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain [anthropogenic] anthropogenic and include hunting, [habitat degradation] habitat degradation , and fishing-related fatalities. Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths, although there are no precise statistics. Most issues with [industrial fishing] industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong populations are low, with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters. As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period, they are highly prone to death due to entanglement. The use of [shark nets] shark nets has historically caused large numbers of deaths, and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited hooks. Hunting has historically been a problem too, although in most areas they are no longer hunted, except in certain indigenous communities. In areas such as northern Australia, hunting has the greatest impact on the dugong population. 
Vessel strikes have proved a problem for manatees, but the relevance of this to dugongs is unknown. Increasing boat traffic has increased danger, especially in shallow waters. [Ecotourism] Ecotourism has increased in some countries, although the effects remain undocumented. It has been seen to cause issues in areas such as [Hainan] Hainan due to [environmental degradation] environmental degradation . Modern farming practices and increased [land clearing] land clearing have also had an impact, and much of the coastline of dugong habitats is undergoing [industrialization] industrialization , with increasing human populations. Dugongs accumulate heavy metal ions in their tissues throughout their lives, more so than other marine mammals. The effects are unknown. 
While international cooperation to form a conservative unit has been undertaken, socio-political needs are an impediment to dugong conservation in many developing countries. The shallow waters are often used as a source of food and income, problems exacerbated by aid used to improve fishing. In many countries, legislation does not exist to protect dugongs, and if it does it is not enforced. 
[Oil spills] Oil spills are a danger to dugongs in some areas, as is [land reclamation] land reclamation . In [Okinawa] Okinawa , the small dugong population is threatened by United States military activity. [Plans exist to build a military base] Plans exist to build a military base close to the [Henoko] Henoko reef, and military activity also adds the threats of noise pollution, chemical pollution, soil erosion, and exposure to depleted [uranium] uranium . The military base plans have been fought in US courts by some Okinawans, whose concerns include the impact on the local environment and dugong habitats. It was later revealed that the government of Japan was hiding evidence of the negative effects of ship lanes and human activities on dugongs observed during surveys carried out off Henoko reef. One of the three individuals has not been observed since June 2015, corresponding to the start of the excavation operations. 
=== Environmental degradation ===
If dugongs do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young. Food shortages can be caused by many factors, such as a loss of habitat, death and decline in the quality of seagrass, and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity. [Sewage] Sewage , [detergents] detergents , [heavy metals] heavy metals , hypersaline water, [herbicides] herbicides , and other waste products all negatively affect seagrass meadows. Human activity such as mining, [trawling] trawling , [dredging] dredging , [land reclamation] land reclamation , and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in [sedimentation] sedimentation which smothers [seagrass] seagrass and prevents light from reaching it. This is the most significant negative factor affecting seagrass. 
Halophila ovalis [Halophila ovalis] Halophila ovalis —one of the dugong's preferred species of seagrass—declines rapidly due to lack of light, dying completely after 30 days. Extreme weather such as [cyclones] cyclones and [floods] floods can destroy hundreds of square kilometres of seagrass meadows, as well as wash dugongs ashore. The recovery of seagrass meadows and the spread of seagrass into new areas, or areas where it has been destroyed, can take over a decade. Most measures for protection involve restricting activities such as trawling in areas containing seagrass meadows, with little to no action on pollutants originating from land. In some areas, water salinity is increased due to [wastewater] wastewater , and it is unknown how much salinity seagrass can withstand. 
Dugong habitat in the [Oura Bay] Oura Bay area of [Henoko, Okinawa, Japan] Henoko, Okinawa, Japan , is currently under threat from land reclamation conducted by the Japanese Government in order to build a US Marine base in the area. In August 2014, preliminary drilling [surveys] surveys were conducted around the seagrass beds there. The construction is expected to seriously damage the dugong population's habitat, possibly leading to local extinction. 
=== Capture and captivity ===
The Australian state of [Queensland] Queensland has sixteen dugong protection parks, and some preservation zones have been established where even [Aboriginal Peoples] Aboriginal Peoples are not allowed to hunt. Capturing animals for research has caused only one or two deaths; dugongs are expensive to keep in captivity due to the long time mothers and calves spend together, and the inability to grow the seagrass that dugongs eat in an aquarium. Only one orphaned calf has ever been successfully kept in captivity. 
Worldwide, only three dugongs are held in captivity. A female from the Philippines lives at [Toba Aquarium] Toba Aquarium in [Toba, Mie] Toba, Mie , Japan. A male also lived there until he died on 10 February 2011. The second resides in [Sea World Indonesia] Sea World Indonesia , after having been rescued from a fisherman's net and treated. The last one, a male, is kept at [Sydney Aquarium] Sydney Aquarium , where he has resided since he was a juvenile. Sydney Aquarium had a second dugong for many years, until she died in 2018. 
Gracie, a captive dugong at [Underwater World, Singapore] Underwater World, Singapore , was reported to have died in 2014 at the age of 19, from complications arising from an acute [digestive disorder] digestive disorder .

The saola saola ( Pseudoryx nghetinhensis Pseudoryx nghetinhensis Pseudoryx nghetinhensis ), also called spindlehorn spindlehorn , Asian unicorn Asian unicorn , or infrequently, Vu Quang bovid Vu Quang bovid , is one of the world's rarest large [mammals] mammals , a forest-dwelling [bovine] bovine native to the [Annamite Range] Annamite Range in [Vietnam] Vietnam and [Laos] Laos . It was described in 1993 following a discovery of remains in [Vũ Quang National Park] Vũ Quang National Park by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the [World Wide Fund for Nature] World Wide Fund for Nature . Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods as they died within a matter of weeks to months. The species was first reported in 1992 by Do Tuoc, a forest [ecologist] ecologist , and his associates. The first photograph of a living saola was taken in captivity in 1993. The most recent one was taken in 2013 by a movement-triggered camera in the forest of central Vietnam. It is the [only species] only species in the [genus] genus  Pseudoryx Pseudoryx Pseudoryx .
== Taxonomy ==
In May 1992, the Ministry of Forestry, [Vietnam] Vietnam sent a survey team to examine the biodiversity of the newly established [Vu Quang National Park] Vu Quang National Park . On this team were Do Tuoc, Le Van Cham and Vu Van Dung (of the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute); Nguyen Van Sang (of the Institute of Ecological and Biological Resources); Nguyen Thai Tu (of [Vinh University] Vinh University ); and John MacKinnon (of the [World Wildlife Fund] World Wildlife Fund ). On 21 May, the team procured a skull featuring a pair of strange, long and pointed [horns] horns from a local hunter. They came across a similar pair in the [Annamite Range] Annamite Range in the northeastern region of the reserve the following day. The team ascribed these features to a new [bovid] bovid species, calling it the ""saola"" or the ""Vu Quang ox"" to avoid confusion with the [sympatric] sympatric  [serow] serow . The WWF officially announced the discovery of the new species on 17 July 1992. 
According to biodiversity specialist Tony Whitten, though Vietnam boasts a variety of flora and fauna, many of which have been recently described, the discovery of as large an animal as the saola was quite unexpected. The saola was the first large mammal to be discovered in the area for 50 years. Observations of live saola have been few and far between, restricted to the [Annamite Range] Annamite Range . 
The [scientific name] scientific name of the saola is Pseudoryx nghetinhensis Pseudoryx nghetinhensis . It is the sole member of the [genus] genus  Pseudoryx Pseudoryx and is classified under the [family] family  [Bovidae] Bovidae . The [species] species was first [described] described in 1993 by Vu Van Dung, Do Tuoc, biologists Pham Mong Giao and Nguyen Ngoc Chinh, Peter Arctander of the [University of Copenhagen] University of Copenhagen and John MacKinnon. The discovery of saola remains in 1992 generated huge scientific interest due to the animal's special physical traits. The saola differs significantly from all other bovid genera in appearance and morphology, enough to place it in its own genus ( Pseudoryx Pseudoryx ).
A recent sequencing study of [ribosomal] ribosomal  [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA of a large taxon sample divides the bovid family into two major subfamilial clades. The first clade is the subfamily [Bovinae] Bovinae consisting of three tribes: [Bovini] Bovini (cattle and buffaloes, including the saola), Tragelaphini ( [Strepsicerotini] Strepsicerotini ) (African spiral-horned bovids) and [Boselaphini] Boselaphini (the [nilgai] nilgai and [four-horned antelope] four-horned antelope ). The second clade is the subfamily [Antelopinae] Antelopinae , which includes all other bovids. Antelopinae is composed of the three tribes: [Caprini] Caprini (goats, sheep, and muskox), [Hippotragini] Hippotragini (horse-like antelopes), and [Antilopini] Antilopini (gazelles).
Since its physical traits are so complex to classify, Pseudoryx Pseudoryx had been classified variously as member of the subfamily [Caprinae] Caprinae and as belonging to any of the three tribes of the subfamily Bovinae: Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. DNA analysis has led scientists to place the saola as a member of the tribe Bovini. The morphology of its horns, teeth and some other features indicate it should be grouped with less-derived or more ancestral bovids. Scientific consensus may lead to classifying the saola as the sole member of a proposed new tribe, Pseudorygini.
=== Etymology ===
The name 'saola' has been translated as "" [spindle] spindle [-horned]"", although the precise meaning is actually ""spinning-wheel post horn"". The name comes from a [Tai] Tai language of Vietnam. The meaning is the same in [Lao language] Lao language ( ເສົາຫລາ ເສົາຫລາ ເສົາຫລາ , also spelled ເສົາຫຼາ ເສົາຫຼາ ເສົາຫຼາ /sǎo-lǎː/ in Lao). The specific name nghetinhensis nghetinhensis refers to the two Vietnamese provinces of [Nghệ An] Nghệ An and [Hà Tĩnh] Hà Tĩnh , while Pseudoryx Pseudoryx acknowledges the animal's similarities with the Arabian or African [oryx] oryx . The [Hmong people] Hmong people in Laos refer to the animal as saht-supahp saht-supahp , a term derived from Lao ( ສັດສຸພາບ ສັດສຸພາບ ສັດສຸພາບ /sàt supʰáːp/) meaning ""the polite animal"", because it moves quietly through the forest. Other names used by minority groups in the saola's range are lagiang lagiang ( [Van Kieu] Van Kieu ), a ngao a ngao ( [Ta Oi] Ta Oi ) and xoong xor xoong xor ( [Katu] Katu ) In the press, saolas have been referred to as ""Asian unicorns"", an appellation apparently due to its rarity and reported gentle nature, and perhaps because both the saola and the oryx have been linked with the [unicorn] unicorn . No known link exists with the Western unicorn myth or the ""Chinese unicorn"", the [qilin] qilin . 
== Description ==
In a 1998 publication, William G. Robichaud, the coordinator of the [Saola Working Group] Saola Working Group , recorded physical measurements for a captive female saola he dubbed 'Martha', in a Laotian menagerie. She was observed for around 15 days until she died from unknown causes. Robichaud noted the height of the female as 84 centimetres (33 in) at the shoulder; the back was slightly elevated, nearly 12 centimetres (4.7 in) taller than the shoulder height. The head-and-body length was recorded as 150 centimetres (4.9 ft). The general characteristics of the saola, as shown by studies during 1993–5 as well as the 1998 study, include a chocolate brown coat with patches of white on the face, throat and the sides of the neck, a paler shade of brown on the neck and the belly, a black dorsal stripe, and a pair of nearly parallel horns, present on both sexes. 
Robichaud noted that the hair, straight and 1.5–2.5 centimetres (0.59–0.98 in) long, was soft and thin–a feature unusual for an animal that is associated with montane habitats in at least a few parts of its range. While the hair was found to be short on the head and the neck, it thickened to woolly hair on the insides of the forelegs and the belly. Studies before 1998 reported a hint of red in the inspected skins. The neck and the belly are a paler shade of brown compared to the rest of the body. A common observation in all the three aforementioned studies is a 0.5 centimetres (0.20 in) thick stripe extending from the shoulders to the tail along the middle of the back. The tail, which measured 23 centimetres (9.1 in) in Robichaud's specimen, is divided into three horizontal bands, brown at the base, black at the tip and white in the middle. Saola skin is 1–2 millimetres (0.039–0.079 in) thick over most of the body, but thickens to 5 millimetres (0.20 in) near the nape of the neck and at the upper shoulders. This adaptation is thought to protect against both predators and rivals' horns during fights. Saolas weigh between approximately 80–100 kg (176–220 lbs). 
The saola has round [pupils] pupils with dark-brown [irises] irises that appear orange when light is shone into them; a cluster of white whiskers about 2 centimetres (0.79 in) long with a presumably tactile function protrude from the end of the chin. The specimen Robichaud observed could extend its tongue up to 16 centimetres (6.3 in) and reach its eyes and upper parts of the face; the upper surface of the tongue is covered with fine, backward-pointing barbs. Robichaud observed that either of the two maxillary glands ( [sinuses] sinuses ) had a nearly rectangular hollow with the dimensions 9×3.5×1.5 centimetres (3.54×1.38×0.59 in), covered by a 0.8 centimetres (0.31 in) thick flap. The maxillary glands of the saola are probably the largest among those of all other animals. The glands are covered by a thick, pungent, grayish green, semi-solid secretion beneath which lies a sheath of few flat hairs. Robichaud observed several pores, used probably for secretion, on the upper surface of the lid. Each white facial spot shelters one or more nodules from which originate 2–2.5 centimetres (0.79–0.98 in) long white or black hairs. These secretions are typically rubbed against the underside of vegetation, leaving a musky, pungent paste. The [spoor] spoor of the forelegs measured 5–6 centimetres (2.0–2.4 in) long by 5.3–6.4 centimetres (2.1–2.5 in) wide, and 6 centimetres (2.4 in) long by 5.7–6 centimetres (2.2–2.4 in) for the hindlegs. 
Both sexes possess slightly divergent horns that are similar in appearance and form almost the same angle with the skull, but differ in their lengths. Horns resemble the parallel wooden posts locally used to support a spinning wheel (thus the familiar name ""spindlehorn""). These are generally dark-brown or black and about 35–50 cm long; twice the length of their head. Studies in 1993 and 1995 gave the maximum distance between the horn tips of wild specimens as 20 centimetres (7.9 in), but the female observed by Robichaud showed a divergence of 25 centimetres (9.8 in) between the tips. Robichaud noted that the horns were 7.5 centimetres (3.0 in) apart at the base. While studies prior to Robichaud's claim the horns are uniformly circular in cross-section, Robichaud observed his specimen had horns with a nearly oval cross-section. The sides of the base of the horns is rugged and indented. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The saola has one of the smallest ranges of any large mammal. It inhabits wet evergreen or deciduous forests in eastern Southeast Asia, preferring river valleys. Sightings have been reported from steep river valleys at 300–1,800 metres (980–5,910 ft) above sea level. In Vietnam and Laos, the species' range appears to cover approximately 5,000 km (1,900 sq mi), including four [nature reserves] nature reserves . During the winters, it migrates to the lowlands. In the northern [Annamite Mountains] Annamite Mountains , it was sighted mostly near streams at elevations of 592–1,112 metres (1,942–3,648 ft). 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
Local people reported that the saola is active in the day as well as at night, but prefers resting during the hot midday hours. Robichaud noted that the captive female was active mainly during the day, but pointed out that the observation could have been influenced by the unfamiliar surroundings the animal found herself in. When she rested, she would draw her forelegs inward to her belly, extend her neck so that her chin touched the ground, and close her eyes. Though apparently solitary, saola have been reported in groups of two or three as well as up to six or seven. Grouping patterns of the saola resemble those of the [bushbuck] bushbuck , [anoa] anoa , and [sitatunga] sitatunga . 
Robichaud observed that the captive female was calm in the presence of humans, but was afraid of dogs. On an encounter with a dog, she would resort to snorting and thrust her head forward, pointing her horns at her opponent. Her erect ears pointed backward, and she stood stiffly with her back arched. Meanwhile, she hardly paid any attention to her surroundings. This female was found to urinate and defecate separately, dropping her hind legs and lowering her lower body – a common observation among bovids. She would spend considerable time grooming herself with her strong tongue. Marking behaviour in the female involved opening up the flap of the maxillary [gland] gland and leaving a pungent secretion on rocks and vegetation. She would give out short bleats occasionally. 
=== Diet ===
Robichaud offered [spleenwort] spleenwort ( Asplenium Asplenium ), Homalomena [Homalomena] Homalomena , and various species of broad-leaved shrubs or trees of the family [Sterculiaceae] Sterculiaceae to the captive animal. The saola fed on all plants, and showed a preference for the Sterculiaceae species. She did not pull at leaves, she would rather chew or pull them into her mouth using her long tongue. She fed mainly during the day, and rarely in the dark. The saola is also reputed to feed on Schismatoglottis [Schismatoglottis] Schismatoglottis , unlike other herbivores in its range. 
=== Reproduction ===
Very little information is available about the reproductive cycle of the saola. The saola is likely to have a fixed [mating] mating season, from late August to mid-November; only single calf births have been documented, mainly during summer between mid-April and late June. In the absence of more specific data, the [gestation] gestation period has been estimated as similar to that of Tragelaphus [Tragelaphus] Tragelaphus species, about 33 weeks. Three reports of saola killings from nearby villagers involved young accompanying mothers. One possessed 9.5 cm (3.7 in) long horns, another an estimated 15 cm (5.9 in), and the third 18.8 cm (7.4 in); these varying horn lengths suggest a birth season extending over at least two to three months. 
== Conservation ==
The saola is currently considered to be [critically endangered] critically endangered . Its restrictive habitat requirements and aversion to human proximity are likely to endanger it through [habitat loss] habitat loss and [habitat fragmentation] habitat fragmentation . Saola suffer losses through local [hunting] hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and for use of the meat in restaurants and food markets. They also sometimes get caught in snares that have been set to catch animals raiding crops, such as [wild boar] wild boar , [sambar] sambar , and [muntjac] muntjac . More than 26,651 snares have so far been removed from saola habitats by conservation groups. 
The key feature of the area occupied by the saola is its remoteness from human disturbance. Saola are shot for their meat, but hunters also gain high esteem in the village for the production of a carcass. Due to the scarcity, the locals place much more value on the saola than more common species. Because the people in this area are traditional hunters, their attitude about killing the saola is hard to change; this makes conservation difficult. The intense interest from the scientific community has actually motivated hunters to capture live specimens. Commercial logging has been stopped in the nature reserve area of Bu Huong, and there is an official ban on forest clearance within the boundaries of the reserve. 
Species of conservation concern are frequently hard to study; there are often delays in implementing or identifying necessary conservation needs due to lack of data. Because the species is so rare, there is a continuous lack of adequate data; this is one of the major problems facing saola conservation. Trained scientists have never observed saola in the wild. Unfortunately, because it is unlikely that intact saola populations exist, field surveys to discover these populations are not a conservation priority. 
The [Saola Working Group] Saola Working Group was formed by the [IUCN] IUCN Species Survival Commission's Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, in 2006 to protect the saolas and their [habitat] habitat . This coalition includes about 40 experts from the forestry departments of Laos and Vietnam, Vietnam's Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vinh University, biologists and conservationists from [Wildlife Conservation Society] Wildlife Conservation Society , and the World Wide Fund for Nature. 
A group of scientists from the [Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology] Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in central Hanoi, within the Institute of Biotechnology, investigated a last resort effort of conserving the species by cloning, an extremely difficult approach even in the case of well-understood species. However, the lack of female saola donors of [enucleated] enucleated  [ovocytes] ovocytes and receptive females, as well as the interspecific barriers, greatly compromise the potential success of the cloning technique. 
Researchers have stationed within villages around the Phou Sithon Endangered Species Conservation Area (PST) where Saolos have been spotted. Based on interviews that were conducted amongst the villagers, they have stated that poachers enter the restricted areas, illegally hunting the last of Saolas.  
They have stressed the need for more human regulation to be enforced in order to keep the sustainability of wildlife in check.

It is [endemic] endemic to [New Zealand] New Zealand . 
Kākāpō can be up to 64 cm (25 in) long. They have a combination of unique traits  among parrots: finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct [facial disc] facial disc , owl-style forward-facing eyes with surrounding discs of specially-textured feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large blue feet, relatively short wings and a short tail. It is the world's only [flightless] flightless parrot, the world's heaviest parrot, and also is nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low [basal metabolic rate] basal metabolic rate , and does not have male [parental care] parental care . It is the only parrot to have a [polygynous] polygynous  [lek] lek breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds, with a reported lifespan of up to 100 years. Adult males weigh around 1.5–3 kilograms (3.3–6.6 lb); the equivalent figure for females is 0.950–1.6 kilograms (2.09–3.53 lb).
The anatomy of the kākāpō typifies the tendency of bird-evolution on oceanic islands. With few predators and abundant food, kākāpō exhibit [island syndrome] island syndrome development, having a generally-robust torso physique at the expense of flight abilities, resulting in reduced shoulder- and wing-muscles, along with a diminished [keel] keel on the [sternum] sternum . Like many other [New Zealand bird species] New Zealand bird species , the kākāpō was historically important to [Māori] Māori , the indigenous people of New Zealand. It appears in [Māori mythology] Māori mythology . Heavily hunted in the past, it was used by the Māori both for its meat and for its feathers.
The kākāpō is critically endangered; the total known population of living individuals is 244 (as of 2024). Known individuals are named, tagged and confined to four small New Zealand islands, all of which are clear of predators; however, in 2023, a reintroduction to mainland New Zealand ( [Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari] Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari ) was accomplished. Introduced mammalian predators, such as cats, rats, [ferrets] ferrets , and [stoats] stoats almost wiped out the kākāpō. All conservation efforts were unsuccessful until the Kākāpō Recovery Programme began in 1995.
== Taxonomy ==
The kākāpō was [formally described] formally described and illustrated in 1845 by the English [ornithologist] ornithologist  [George Robert Gray] George Robert Gray . He created a new [genus] genus and coined the [binomial name] binomial name  Strigops habroptilus Strigops habroptilus Strigops habroptilus . Gray was uncertain about the origin of his specimen and wrote, ""This remarkable bird is found in one of the islands of the South Pacific Ocean."" The [type location] type location has been designated as [Dusky Sound] Dusky Sound on the southwest corner of New Zealand's [South Island] South Island . The generic name Strigops Strigops Strigops is derived from the [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek  strix strix strix , genitive strigos strigos strigos (""owl""), and ops ops ops (""face""), while its specific [epithet] epithet  habroptilus habroptilus habroptilus comes from habros habros habros (""soft""), and ptilon ptilon ptilon (""feather""). 
In 1955 the [International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature] International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled that the genus name Strigops Strigops Strigops was [feminine] feminine . Based on this ruling many ornithologists used the form Strigops habroptila Strigops habroptila but in 2023 James L. Savage and Andrew Digby argued that under the current ICZN rules the specific epithet should be habroptilus habroptilus . This view was accepted by ornithologists and in 2024 the [International Ornithological Congress] International Ornithological Congress Checklist and the eBird/Clements Checklist changed the spelling of the binomial name back to Strigops habroptilus Strigops habroptilus . The species is [monotypic] monotypic , as no subspecies are recognised. 
The name kākāpō kākāpō kākāpō is [Māori] Māori , from kākā kākā kākā (""parrot"") + pō pō pō (""night""); the name is both singular and plural. ""Kākāpō"" is increasingly written in [New Zealand English] New Zealand English with the [macrons] macrons that indicate [long vowels] long vowels . The correct pronunciation in Māori is [kaːkaːpɔː] [[kaːkaːpɔː]] [kaːkaːpɔː] ; other colloquial pronunciations exist, however. These include the [British English] British English  [/ˈkɑːkəpoʊ/] / ˈ ˈ k k ɑː ɑː k k ə ə p p oʊ oʊ / ( [KAH-kə-poh] KAH KAH -kə-poh ), as defined in the [Chambers Dictionary] Chambers Dictionary in 2003. 
The kākāpō is placed in the family [Strigopidae] Strigopidae together with the two species in the genus Nestor [Nestor] Nestor , the [kea] kea ( Nestor notabilis Nestor notabilis Nestor notabilis ) and the [kākā] kākā ( Nestor meridionalis Nestor meridionalis Nestor meridionalis ). The [birds are endemic to New Zealand] birds are endemic to New Zealand .  [Molecular phylogenetic] Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the family Strigopidae is [basal] basal to the other three parrot families in the order [Psittaciformes] Psittaciformes and diverged from them 33–44 million years ago. The common ancestor of the kākāpō and the two Nestor Nestor species diverged 27–40 million years ago. 
Earlier [ornithologists] ornithologists felt that the kākāpō might be related to the [ground parrots] ground parrots and [night parrot] night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by molecular studies; rather, the [cryptic] cryptic colour seems to be [adaptation] adaptation to terrestrial habits that evolved twice [convergently] convergently . 
== Description ==
The kākāpō is a large, rotund parrot. Adults can measure from 58 to 64 cm (23 to 25 in) in length with a wingspan of 82 cm (32 in). Males are significantly heavier than females with an average weight of 2 kg (4.4 lb) compared with just 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) for females. Kākāpō are the heaviest living species of parrot and on average weigh about 400 g (14 oz) more than the largest flying parrot, the [hyacinth macaw] hyacinth macaw . 
The kākāpō cannot fly, having relatively short wings for its size and lacking the [keel] keel on the [sternum] sternum (breastbone), where the flight muscles of other birds attach. It uses its wings for balance and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike many other land birds, the kākāpō can accumulate large amounts of body fat. 
The upper parts of the kākāpō have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity – museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [specific epithet] specific epithet  habroptila habroptila . The kākāpō has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the ""owl parrot"". The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble [vibrissae] vibrissae or ""whiskers""; it is possible kākāpō use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kākāpō feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [zygodactyl] zygodactyl (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground. 
Females are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller [cere] cere and [nostrils] nostrils , more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a [brood patch] brood patch of bare skin on the belly. 
The kākāpō's [altricial] altricial young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green colouration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resembles eyelashes. 
Like many other parrots, kākāpō have a variety of calls. As well as the booms booms (see [below] below for a recording) and chings chings of their mating calls, they will often loudly skraark skraark . 
The kākāpō has a well-developed [sense of smell] sense of smell , which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species. The kākāpō has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots. One of the most striking characteristics of the kākāpō is its distinct musty-sweet odour. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kākāpō. 
As a nocturnal species, the kākāpō has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its [optic tectum] optic tectum , nucleus rotundus, and [entopallium] entopallium are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight. These modifications allow the kākāpō to have enhanced light sensitivity but with poor visual acuity. 
=== Internal anatomy ===
The skeleton of the kākāpō differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, [vestigial] vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the [furcula] furcula is not fused but consists of a pair of [clavicles] clavicles lying in contact with each [coracoid] coracoid . As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kākāpō has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and wing are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short. 
The [pectoral] pectoral musculature of the kākāpō is also modified by flightlessness. The pectoralis and [supracoracoideus] supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced. The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is tendinous. There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that is associated with the large [crop] crop . 
=== Genetics ===
Because kākāpō passed through a [genetic bottleneck] genetic bottleneck , in which their world population was reduced to 49 birds, they are extremely inbred and have low genetic diversity. This manifests in lower disease resistance and in fertility problems: 61% of kākāpō eggs fail to hatch. Beginning in 2015, the Kākāpō 125+ project has sequenced the [genome] genome of all living kākāpō, as well as some museum specimens. The project is a collaboration led by Genomics Aotearoa and a collaboration with a team of international collaborators. 
A [DNA sequence analysis] DNA sequence analysis was performed on 35 kākāpō genomes of the surviving descendants of an isolated island population, and on 14 genomes, mainly from museum specimens, of the now extinct mainland population. An analysis of the long-term genetic impact of small population size indicated that the small island kākāpō population had a reduced number of harmful [mutations] mutations compared to the number in mainland individuals. It was hypothesized that the reduced mutational load of the island population was due to a combination of [genetic drift] genetic drift and the purging of deleterious mutations through increased [inbreeding] inbreeding and [purifying selection] purifying selection that occurred since the isolation of this population from the mainland about 10,000 years ago. Purging of deleterious mutations occurs when there is selection against recessive or partially recessive detrimental [alleles] alleles as they are expressed in the [homozygous state] homozygous state . 
== Habitat ==
Before the arrival of humans, the kākāpō was distributed throughout both main islands of New Zealand. Although it may have inhabited [Stewart Island / Rakiura] Stewart Island / Rakiura before human arrival, it has not been found in the extensive fossil collections from there. Kākāpō lived in a variety of habitats, including [tussocklands] tussocklands , scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests dominated by [podocarps] podocarps ( [rimu] rimu , [mataī] mataī , [kahikatea] kahikatea , [tōtara] tōtara ), [beeches] beeches , [tawa] tawa , and [rātā] rātā . In [Fiordland] Fiordland , areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as [five finger] five finger , [wineberry] wineberry , [bush lawyer] bush lawyer , [tutu] tutu , [hebes] hebes , and [coprosmas] coprosmas – became known as ""kākāpō gardens"". 
The kākāpō is considered to be a ""habitat generalist"". Though they are now confined to islands free of predation, they were once able to live in nearly any climate present on the islands of New Zealand. They survived dry, hot summers on the North Island as well as cold winter temperatures in the sub-alpine areas of Fiordland. Kākāpō seem to have preferred broadleaf or [mountain beech] mountain beech and [Hall's tōtara] Hall's tōtara forest with mild winters and high rainfall, but the species was not exclusively forest-dwelling. 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
The kākāpō is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night. 
Though the kākāpō cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also ""parachute"" – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees. With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kākāpō cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kākāpō is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. When foraging, kākāpō tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called ""browse signs"". 
Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. [Locomotion] Locomotion is often by way of a rapid ""jog-like"" gait by which it can move several kilometres. A female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to 1 km (0.6 mi) away and the male may walk from its home range to a mating arena up to 5 km (3 mi) away during the mating season (October–January). 
Young birds indulge in play fighting, and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin. The kākāpō is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kākāpō, which have distinct personalities. Despite this, kākāpō are solitary birds. 
The kākāpō was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand, and was well adapted to avoid the birds of prey which were their only predators. As well as the [New Zealand falcon] New Zealand falcon , there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: [Haast's eagle] Haast's eagle and [Eyles' harrier] Eyles' harrier . All these [raptors] raptors soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid them the kākāpō evolved camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. When a kākāpō feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the vegetation its plumage resembles. Kākāpō were not entirely safe at night, when the [laughing owl] laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from owl nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that kākāpō were among their prey. 
Kākāpō defensive adaptations were no use, however, against the mammalian predators introduced to New Zealand by humans. Birds hunt very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually hunt by day. Mammalian predators, in contrast to birds, often hunt by night, and rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey; a common way for humans to hunt kākāpō was by releasing trained dogs.  The kākāpō's adaptations to avoid avian predation have thus been useless against its new enemies, and the reason for its massive decline since the introduction of dogs, cats and [mustelids] mustelids (see Conservation: Human impact [Conservation: Human impact] Conservation: Human impact ). 
=== Breeding ===
Kākāpō are the only flightless bird that has a [lek] lek breeding system. Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or ""lek"". They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate. 
During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to 5 kilometres (3 mi) from a kākāpō's usual territory and are an average of 50 metres (160 ft) apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them. Mating occurs only approximately every five years, with the ripening of the [rimu] rimu fruit. In mating years, males may make ""booming"" calls for 6–8 hours every night for more than four months. 
Each court consists of one or more saucer-shaped depressions or ""bowls"" dug in the ground by the male, up to 10 centimetres (4 in) deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The kākāpō is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound: the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males' booming mating calls. Each male's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend 50 metres (160 ft) along a ridge or 20 metres (70 ft) in diameter around a hilltop. Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. 
To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100   [Hz] Hz ) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a [thoracic] thoracic sac. They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After a sequence of about 20 loud booms, the male kākāpō emits a high-frequency, metallic ""ching"" sound. He stands for a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).  Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard. Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard. 
Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 40 minutes or more. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female. 
The female kākāpō lays 1–4 eggs per breeding cycle, with several days between eggs. The nest is placed on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs beginning after the first egg is laid, but is forced to leave the nest every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs, and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kākāpō eggs usually hatch within 30 days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. The female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after [fledging] fledging . The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12 weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 3 months. 
The kākāpō is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 60 (plus or minus 20) years, and tends to reach adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5 years of age. It was thought that females reached [sexual maturity] sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but four five-year-old females have now been recorded reproducing. The kākāpō does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests, such as those on Whenua Hou, kākāpō breeding occurs as infrequently. 
Another aspect of the kākāpō's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female in good condition produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kākāpō will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kākāpō will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the [Trivers–Willard hypothesis] Trivers–Willard hypothesis . The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species. 
=== Feeding ===
The beak of the kākāpō is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the kākāpō has a very small [gizzard] gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is entirely [herbivorous] herbivorous , eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen, fungi and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kākāpō food. It is specifically fond of the fruit of the [rimu] rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kākāpō strips out the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kākāpō is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter. 
Kākāpō diet changes according to the season. The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of Lycopodium ramulosum [Lycopodium ramulosum] Lycopodium ramulosum , Lycopodium fastigium Lycopodium fastigium , Schizaea fistulosa Schizaea fistulosa , Blechnum minus Blechnum minus , Blechnum procerum Blechnum procerum , Cyathodes juniperina Cyathodes juniperina , Dracophyllum longifolium Dracophyllum longifolium , Olearia colensoi Olearia colensoi and Thelymitra venosa Thelymitra venosa . Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. Kākāpō may forage heavily in certain areas, leaving, on occasion, more than 30 droppings and conspicuous evidence of herbivory. These areas, which are mostly dominated by [mānuka] mānuka and [yellow silver pine] yellow silver pine , range from 100 – 5,000 sq. metres (1,076 – 53,820 sq. feet) per individual. 
Preserved [coprolites] coprolites of kākāpō have been studied to obtain information on the historic diet of the bird. This research has identified 67 native plant genera previously unrecorded as food sources for kākāpō including native mistletoes as well as Dactylanthus taylorii [Dactylanthus taylorii] Dactylanthus taylorii . 
== Conservation ==
Fossil records indicate that in pre-Polynesian times, the kākāpō was New Zealand's third most common bird and it was widespread on all three main islands. However, the kākāpō population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country, and its conservation status as ranked by the Department of Conservation continues to be ""Nationally Critical"". Since the 1890s, conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kākāpō Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1995 and continues to this day. Kākāpō are absolutely protected under New Zealand's [Wildlife Act 1953] Wildlife Act 1953 . The species is also listed under Appendix I of the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meaning international export/import (including parts and derivatives) is regulated. 
=== Human impact ===
The first factor in the decline of the kākāpō was the arrival of humans. [Māori folklore] Māori folklore suggests that the kākāpō was found throughout the country when the [Polynesians] Polynesians first arrived in [Aotearoa] Aotearoa 700 years ago.  [Subfossil] Subfossil and [midden] midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North and South Island before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the kākāpō for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into [cloaks] cloaks . 
Due to its inability to fly, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kākāpō was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the [Polynesian rat] Polynesian rat or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand as a stowaway. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kākāpō. Although the kākāpō was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the [Tararua] Tararua and [Aorangi Ranges] Aorangi Ranges , it was locally abundant in parts of New Zealand, such as the central North Island and forested parts of the South Island. 
Although kākāpō numbers were reduced by Māori settlement, they declined much more rapidly after European colonisation. Beginning in the 1840s, [Pākehā] Pākehā settlers [cleared vast tracts of land] cleared vast tracts of land for farming and grazing, further reducing kākāpō habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and [stoats] stoats .  Europeans knew little of the kākāpō until Gray described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kākāpō. In the late 19th century, the kākāpō became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kākāpō population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct.

From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kākāpō population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct. 
In the 1880s, large numbers of mustelids (stoats, ferrets and weasels) were released in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers, but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the kākāpō. Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kākāpō for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The kākāpō was reportedly still present near the head of the [Whanganui River] Whanganui River as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kākāpō in the North Island being a single bird caught in the [Kaimanawa Ranges] Kaimanawa Ranges by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895. 
=== Early protection efforts ===
In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside [Resolution Island] Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed [Richard Henry] Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kākāpō and [kiwi] kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kākāpō to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, [stoats] stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kākāpō population within 6 years. 
In 1903, three kākāpō were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of [Little Barrier Island] Little Barrier Island (Hauturu-o-Toi) north-east of [Auckland] Auckland , but [feral cats] feral cats were present and the kākāpō were never seen again. In 1912, three kākāpō were moved to another reserve, [Kapiti Island] Kapiti Island , north-west of [Wellington] Wellington . One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period. 
By the 1920s, the kākāpō was extinct in the [North Island] North Island and its range and numbers in the South Island were declining.  One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kākāpō were becoming scarce. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kākāpō were becoming scarce. 
=== 1950–1989 conservation efforts ===
In the 1950s, the [New Zealand Wildlife Service] New Zealand Wildlife Service was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the kākāpō, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the [Kahurangi National Park] Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kākāpō was caught and released in the [Milford Sound / Piopiotahi] Milford Sound / Piopiotahi catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kākāpō were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [aviaries] aviaries of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [Masterton] Masterton in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kākāpō, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year. 
By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kākāpō was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kākāpō and made the first scientific observations of kākāpō booming. These observations led [Don Merton] Don Merton to speculate for the first time that the kākāpō had a [lek] lek breeding system. From 1974 to 1978 a total of 18 kākāpō were discovered in Fiordland, but all were males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened ""Richard Henry"", and transferred to [Maud Island] Maud Island . All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [glaciated valleys] glaciated valleys flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kākāpō was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs. 
Before 1977, no expedition had been to Stewart Island to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kākāpō were reported on the island. An expedition to Rakiura found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kākāpō. The finding in an eight-thousand-hectare (twenty-thousand-acre) area of fire-modified [scrubland] scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds. 
[Mustelids] Mustelids have never colonised Stewart Island, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was apparent that cats killed kākāpō at a rate of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kākāpō were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997. 
=== Kākāpō Recovery programme ===
In the 1980s the kākāpō were translocated to islands with no predators to maintain their genetic diversity, to avoid spreading harmful diseases, and to reduce interbreeding. 
In 1989, a Kākāpō Recovery plan was developed, and a Kākāpō Recovery programme was established in 1995. The New Zealand [Department of Conservation] Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task.
The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining kākāpō to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kākāpō without [rehabilitation] rehabilitation by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Little Barrier, [Codfish] Codfish and [Mana] Mana . Sixty-five kākāpō (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and [weka] weka kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kākāpō sanctuaries: [Chalky Island (Te Kākahu-o-Tamatea)] Chalky Island (Te Kākahu-o-Tamatea) and [Anchor Island] Anchor Island . The entire kākāpō population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to [Pearl Island] Pearl Island in [Port Pegasus] Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish. All kākāpō on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005. 
A key part of the Recovery Programme is the supplementary feeding of females. Kākāpō breed only once every two to five years, when certain plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produce protein-rich fruit and seeds. During breeding years when rimu masts supplementary food is provided to kākāpō to increase the likelihood of individuals successfully breeding. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum [ad libitum] ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–1991 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low. 
Supplementary feeding affects the [sex ratio] sex ratio of kākāpō offspring, and can be used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal condition.  During the winter of 1981, only females lighter than 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition, and the sex ratio results in 1982 were close to parity, eliminating the male-biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding. During the winter of 1981, only females lighter than 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition, and the sex ratio results in 1982 were close to parity, eliminating the male-biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding. 
Today commercial parrot food is supplied to all individuals of breeding age on Whenua Hou and Anchor. The amount eaten and individual weights are carefully monitored to ensure that optimum body condition is maintained. 
Kākāpō nests are intensively managed by wildlife conservation staff. Before Polynesian rats were removed from Whenua Hou, the rats were a threat to the survival of young kākāpō. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats.  Kākāpō nest protection was intensified after 1995 by using [rat traps] rat traps and rat poison stations as soon as a kākāpō nest was detected. A small video camera and [infra-red light source] infra-red light source would watch the nest continuously and scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. 
All kākāpō islands are now rat-free, but infrared cameras still allow rangers to remotely monitor the behaviour of females and chicks in nests. Data loggers record when mother kākāpō come and go, allowing rangers to pick a time to check on the health of chicks, and also indicate how hard females are having to work to find food. Because mother kākāpō often struggle to successfully rear multiple chicks, Kākāpō Recovery rangers will move chicks between nests as needed. 
Eggs are often removed from nests for incubation to reduce the likelihood of accidents, such as lost eggs or crushing. If chicks become ill, are not putting on weight, or there are too many chicks in the nest (and no available nest to move them to) they will be hand-reared by the Kākāpō Recovery team. In the 2019 season, eggs were also removed from nests to encourage females to re-nest. By hand-raising the first group of chicks in captivity and encouraging females to lay more eggs, the Kākāpō Recovery Team hoped that overall chick production would be increased. By the end of February 2020, the bird's summer breeding season, these efforts led to the production of 80 chicks, ""a record number."" 
To monitor the kākāpō population continuously, each bird is equipped with a [radio transmitter] radio transmitter . Every known kākāpō, barring some young chicks, has been given a name by Kākāpō Recovery Programme officials, and detailed data is gathered about every individual. GPS transmitters are also being trialled to provide more detailed data about the movement of individual birds and their habitat use. The signals also provide behavioural data, letting rangers gather information about mating and nesting remotely.  Every individual kākāpō receives an annual health check and has their transmitter replaced. Every individual kākāpō receives an annual health check and has their transmitter replaced. 
The Kākāpō Recovery programme has been successful, with the numbers of kākāpō increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of kākāpō as a functional component of the [ecosystem] ecosystem in a protected habitat. To help meet this conservation challenge, Resolution Island (20,860 ha (51,500 acres)) in Fiordland has been prepared for kākāpō re-introduction with [ecological restoration] ecological restoration including the eradication of stoats. Ultimately, the Kākāpō Recovery vision for the species is to restore the mauri mauri mauri (Māori for ""life-force"") of the kākāpō by breeding 150 adult females. 
Four males were re-introduced to [Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari] Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari in the North Island on 21 July 2023, becoming the first kākāpō living in mainland New Zealand in almost 40 years. Despite extensive improvements to the perimeter fence, in October 2023, one of the kākāpō escaped by using a downed tree to climb out. The bird was located using the signal from its GPS transmitter and returned to the sanctuary. A second group of six birds was introduced to the sanctuary in September. However, two further kākāpō found a way over the fence, and in November the Department of Conservation temporarily removed three birds from the sanctuary to a southern predator-free island, leaving the kākāpō population in the sanctuary at seven. The Department commented that ""Kākāpō are flightless but are excellent climbers who can use their wings to parachute from treetops"". 
In 2019 an outbreak of the fungal disease aspergillosis [aspergillosis] aspergillosis among kākāpō on the island of Whenua Hou infected 21 individuals and led to 9 deaths: two adults, five chicks and two juveniles. Over 50 birds were transported to veterinary centres for diagnostics and treatment. 
== Population timeline ==
== In Māori culture ==
The kākāpō is associated with a rich tradition of [Māori folklore] Māori folklore and beliefs. The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or "" [masting] masting "" events of particular plant species such as the rimu, which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future. Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the [hinau] hinau and tawa trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the Māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose. 
=== Use for food and clothing ===
The Māori considered the meat of the kākāpō a delicacy and, when the bird was widespread, hunted it for food. One source states that its flesh ""resembles [lamb] lamb in taste and texture"", although European settlers have described the bird as having a ""strong and slightly stringent [sic] flavour"". 
In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their mating arenas made it easy for Māori hunting parties to track the kākāpō down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using [snares] snares , pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated [Polynesian dogs] Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a [hāngī] hāngī or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the [Ngāi Tahu] Ngāi Tahu  iwi iwi [iwi] iwi would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of [tōtara] tōtara tree or in containers constructed from [kelp] kelp . Bundles of kākāpō tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents. The Māori also used the bird's eggs for food. 
As well as eating the meat of the kākāpō, Māori would use kākāpō skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in kākāpō feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes. Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make. Not only were these garments considered very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm. They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered taonga taonga [taonga] taonga (treasures), so much so that the old Māori adage ""You have a kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold"" was used to describe someone who is never satisfied. Kākāpō feathers were also used to decorate the heads of taiaha taiaha [taiaha] taiaha , but were removed before use in combat. 
Despite this, the kākāpō was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the Māori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them [George Edward Grey] George Edward Grey , who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kākāpō's behaviour towards him and his friends was ""more like that of a dog than a bird"". 
== In the media ==
The conservation of the kākāpō has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the kākāpō have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being Two in the Bush Two in the Bush , made by [Gerald Durrell] Gerald Durrell for the [BBC] BBC in 1962. 
A feature-length documentary, The Unnatural History of the Kakapo The Unnatural History of the Kakapo won two major awards at the [Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival] Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival . Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by [NHNZ] NHNZ , are Kakapo – Night Parrot Kakapo – Night Parrot (1982) and To Save the Kakapo To Save the Kakapo (1997).
The BBC's Natural History Unit featured the kākāpō, including a sequence with [Sir David Attenborough] Sir David Attenborough in The Life of Birds [The Life of Birds] The Life of Birds . It was one of the endangered animals [Douglas Adams] Douglas Adams and [Mark Carwardine] Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book Last Chance to See [Last Chance to See] Last Chance to See . An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which [Stephen Fry] Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the kākāpō on Codfish Island / Whenua Hou. Footage of a kākāpō named [Sirocco] Sirocco attempting to mate with Carwardine's head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming ""spokes-bird"" for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010. Sirocco became the inspiration for the party parrot, a popular animated emoji frequently associated with the workflow application [Slack] Slack . 
The kākāpō was featured in the episode ""Strange Islands"" of the documentary series South Pacific [South Pacific] South Pacific , originally aired on 13 June 2009, in the episode ""Worlds Apart"" of the series The Living Planet [The Living Planet] The Living Planet , and in episode 3 of the BBC's New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands . 
In a 2019 kākāpō awareness campaign, the Kākāpō Recovery Programme New Zealand National Partner, [Meridian Energy] Meridian Energy , ran a Search for a Saxophonist Search for a Saxophonist to provide suitable mood music for encouraging mating to coincide with the 2019 kākāpō breeding season. The search and footage from the islands where breeding was taking place were featured on the One News Breakfast One News Breakfast programme. The kākāpō was featured in the mobile game ""Kākāpō Run"" developed by a UK conservation charity. This game aimed to raise support for kākāpō conservation by engaging players in fun, educational gameplay. A study found that playing the game helped increase positive attitudes and actions related to kākāpō protection, such as support for managing invasive predators and responsible pet care, though it did not lead to more donations. 
The bird was voted New Zealand's [bird of the year] bird of the year in 2008 and 2020.

Tarsier,Tarsier,"
Tarsiers Tarsiers ( [/ˈtɑːrsiərz/] / ˈ ˈ t t ɑːr ɑːr s s i i ər ər z z /  [TAR-see-ərz] TAR TAR -see-ərz ) are [haplorhine] haplorhine  [primates] primates of the [family] family  Tarsiidae Tarsiidae , which is, itself, the lone extant family within the infraorder [Tarsiiformes] Tarsiiformes . Although the group was, prehistorically, more globally widespread, all of the [species] species living today are restricted to [Maritime Southeast Asia] Maritime Southeast Asia , predominantly being found in [Brunei] Brunei , [Indonesia] Indonesia , [Malaysia] Malaysia and the [Philippines] Philippines .
They are found primarily in forested habitats, especially forests that have [liana] liana , since the vine gives tarsiers vertical support when climbing trees. 
== Evolutionary history ==
=== Fossil record ===
Fossils of [tarsiiform] tarsiiform primates have been found in Asia, Europe, and North America (with disputed fossils from Northern Africa), but extant tarsiers are restricted to several Southeast Asian islands. The fossil record indicates that their [dentition] dentition has not changed much, except in size, over the past 45 million years.
Within the family Tarsiidae, there are two extinct genera— Xanthorhysis [Xanthorhysis] Xanthorhysis and Afrotarsius [Afrotarsius] Afrotarsius ; however, the placement of Afrotarsius Afrotarsius is not certain, and it is sometimes listed in its own family, [Afrotarsiidae] Afrotarsiidae , within the infraorder Tarsiiformes, or considered an [anthropoid] anthropoid primate. 
So far, four fossil species of tarsiers are known from the fossil record:
The genus Tarsius Tarsius has a longer fossil record than any other primate genus, but the assignment of the Eocene and Miocene fossils to the genus is dubious. 
=== Classification ===
The [phylogenetic] phylogenetic position of extant tarsiers within the order Primates has been debated for much of the 20th century, and tarsiers have alternately been classified with [strepsirrhine] strepsirrhine primates in the suborder Prosimii, or as the sister group to the [simians] simians (Anthropoidea) in the infraorder [Haplorhini] Haplorhini . Analysis of [SINE] SINE insertions, a type of macromutation to the DNA, is argued to offer very persuasive evidence for the [monophyly] monophyly of Haplorhini, where other lines of evidence, such as [DNA sequence] DNA sequence data, remain ambiguous. Thus, some systematists argue the debate is conclusively settled in favor of a monophyletic Haplorrhini. In common with simians, tarsiers have a mutation in the [L-gulonolactone oxidase] L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) gene, which prevents their bodies from synthesizing vitamin C so they must find it in the diet. Since the strepsirrhines do not have this mutation and have retained the ability to make vitamin C, the genetic trait that confers the need for it in the diet would tend to place tarsiers with haplorhines. 
At a lower phylogenetic level, the tarsiers have, until recently, all been placed in the genus Tarsius Tarsius , while it was debated whether the species should be placed in two (a [Sulawesi] Sulawesi and a [Philippine] Philippine -western group) or three separate genera (Sulawesi, Philippine and western groups). Species level [taxonomy] taxonomy is complex, with [morphology] morphology often being of limited use compared to vocalizations. Further confusion existed over the validity of certain names. Among others, the widely used T. dianae T. dianae has been shown to be a [junior synonym] junior synonym of T. dentatus T. dentatus , and comparably, T. spectrum T. spectrum is now considered a junior synonym of T. tarsier T. tarsier . 
In 2010, [Colin Groves] Colin Groves and Myron Shekelle suggested splitting the genus Tarsius Tarsius into three genera, the Philippine tarsiers (genus Carlito [Carlito] Carlito ), the western tarsiers (genus Cephalopachus [Cephalopachus] Cephalopachus ), and the eastern tarsiers (genus Tarsius Tarsius ). This was based on differences in [dentition] dentition , eye size, limb and hand length, tail tufts, tail sitting pads, the number of [mammae] mammae , chromosome count, [socioecology] socioecology , vocalizations, and distribution. The senior taxon of the species, T. tarsier T. tarsier was restricted to the population of a [Selayar] Selayar island, which then required the resurrection of the defunct taxon T. fuscus T. fuscus . 
In 2014, scientists published the results of a genetic study from across the range of the [Philippine tarsier] Philippine tarsier , revealing previously unrecognised genetic diversity. Three subspecies are recognised in the established taxonomy: Carlito syrichta syrichta Carlito syrichta syrichta from [Leyte] Leyte and [Samar] Samar , C. syrichta fraterculus C. syrichta fraterculus from [Bohol] Bohol , and C. syrichta carbonarius C. syrichta carbonarius from [Mindanao] Mindanao . Their analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggested that ssp. syrichta syrichta and fraterculus fraterculus may represent a single lineage, whereas ssp. carbonarius carbonarius may represent two lineages – one occupies the majority of Mindanao while the other is in northeastern Mindanao and the nearby [Dinagat Island] Dinagat Island , which the authors termed the 'Dinagat-Caraga tarsier'. More detailed studies that integrate morphological data will be needed to review the taxonomy of tarsiers in the Philippines. 
== Anatomy and physiology ==
Tarsiers are small animals with enormous eyes; each eyeball is approximately 16 millimetres (0.63 in) in diameter and is as large as, or in some cases larger than, its entire brain. The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey. Tarsiers have a strong auditory sense, and their auditory cortex is distinct. Tarsiers also have long hind limbs, owing mostly to the elongated [tarsus] tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. Tarsiers have soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color. 
Tarsiers morphology allows for them to move their heads 180 degrees in either direction, allowing for them to see 360 degrees around them. Their [dental formula] dental formula is also unique: 2.1.3.3 2.1.3.3 1.1.3.3 1.1.3.3 Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting layer ( [tapetum lucidum] tapetum lucidum ) of the retina and have a [fovea] fovea .
The tarsier's brain is different from that of other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the [lateral geniculate nucleus] lateral geniculate nucleus , which is the main region of the [thalamus] thalamus that receives visual information. The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from [lemurs] lemurs , [lorises] lorises , and [monkeys] monkeys , which are all similar in this respect. Some neuroscientists suggested that ""this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution."" 
[Philippine tarsiers] Philippine tarsiers are capable of hearing frequencies as high as 91 kHz. They are also capable of vocalizations with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz. 
Unlike most primates, male tarsiers do not have [bacula] bacula . 
== Behavior ==
[Pygmy tarsiers] Pygmy tarsiers differ from other species in terms of their morphology, communication, and behavior. The differences in morphology that distinguish pygmy tarsiers from other species are likely based on their high altitude environment. 
All tarsier species are [nocturnal] nocturnal in their habits, but like many nocturnal organisms, some individuals may show more or less activity during the daytime. Based on the anatomy of all tarsiers, they are all adapted for leaping even though they all vary based on their species. 
Ecological variation is responsible for differences in morphology and behavior in tarsiers because different species become adapted to local conditions based on the level of altitude. For example, the colder climate at higher elevations can influence cranial morphology. 
Tarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals and are sensitive to bright lights, loud noises, and physical contact. They have been reported to behave suicidally when stressed or kept in captivity. 
=== Predators ===
Due to their small size, tarsiers are prey to various other animals. Tarsiers primarily inhabit the lower vegetation layers as they face threats from both terrestrial predators such as cats, lizards, and snakes, and aerial predators such as owls and birds. By residing in these lower layers, they can minimize their chances of being preyed upon by staying off the ground and yet still low enough to avoid birds of prey.
Tarsiers, though known as being shy and reclusive, are known to mob predators. In nature, [mobbing] mobbing is the act of harassing predators to reduce the chance of being attacked. When predators are near, tarsiers will make a warning vocalization. Other tarsiers will respond to the call, and within a short period of time, 2-10 tarsiers will show up to mob the predator. The majority of the group consists of adult males, but there will occasionally be a female or two. While tarsier groups only contain one adult male, males from other territories will join in the mob event, meaning there are multiple alpha male tarsiers attacking the predator. 
=== Diet ===
Tarsiers are the only entirely [carnivorous] carnivorous  [extant] extant primates, albeit mainly [insectivorous] insectivorous , catching invertebrates by jumping at them. The tarsiers also opportunistically prey on a variety of arboreal and small forest animals, including [orthopterans] orthopterans , [scarab beetles] scarab beetles , small [flying frogs] flying frogs , [lizards] lizards and, occasionally, amphibious [crabs] crabs that climb into the lower sections of trees. However, it has been found that their favorite prey are [arthropods] arthropods , [beetles] beetles , [arachnids] arachnids , [cockroaches] cockroaches , [grasshoppers] grasshoppers , [katydids] katydids , [cicadas] cicadas , and [walking sticks] walking sticks . Tarsiers are, rarely, also known to prey on baby birds, small tree snakes and even baby bats. 
=== Reproduction ===
[Gestation] Gestation takes about six months, and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone.
== Conservation ==
Tarsiers have never formed successful breeding colonies in captivity. This may be due in part to their special feeding requirements. 
A sanctuary near the town of Corella, on the Philippine island of [Bohol] Bohol , is having some success restoring tarsier populations. The Philippines Tarsier Foundation (PTFI) has developed a large, semi-wild enclosure known as the Tarsier Research and Development Center. Carlito Pizarras, also known as the ""Tarsier man"", founded this sanctuary where visitors can observe tarsiers in the wild. As of 2011, the sanctuary was maintained by him and his brother. The trees in the sanctuary are populated with nocturnal insects that make up the tarsier's diet. 
The conservation status of all tarsiers is vulnerable to extinction. Tarsiers are a conservation dependent species meaning that they need to have more and improved management of protected habitats or they will definitely become extinct in the future. 
The first quantitative study on the activity patterns of captive Philippine Tarsier (Tarsius syrichta) has been studied at the Subayon Conservation Centre for the Philippine Tarsier in Bilar, Bohol, Philippines. From December 2014 to January 2016, Female and male T. syrichta were observed based on their time apportioned to normal activities during non-mating versus mating season. During the non-mating season, a significant amount of their waking hours were spent scanning which proceeded to resting, foraging, and traveling. Feeding, scent-marking, self-grooming, social activities, and other activities were minimal. Scanning was still a common activity among the paired sexes during mating season. However, resting remarkedly decreased while increases in travel and foraging were evident. These findings are being considered for the continuance of housing T.syrichta with successes with captivity due to anthropogenic threats. 
The 2008-described [Siau Island tarsier] Siau Island tarsier in [Indonesia] Indonesia is regarded as [Critically Endangered] Critically Endangered and was listed among [The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates] The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates by [Conservation International] Conservation International and the IUCN/SCC Primate Specialist Group in 2008. The [Malaysian] Malaysian government protects tarsiers by listing them in the Totally Protected Animals of [Sarawak] Sarawak , the Malaysian state in Borneo where they are commonly found. 
A new scheme to conserve the tarsiers of Mount Matutum near Tupi in South Cotabato on the island of Mindanao is being organised by the Tupi civil government and the charity Endangered Species International (ESI). Tarsier UK are also involved on the margins helping the Tupi Government to educate the children of Tupi about the importance of the animal. ESI is hoping to build a visitor centre on the slopes of Mount Matutum and help the local indigenous peoples to farm more environmentally and look after the tarsiers. The first stage in this is educating the local peoples on the importance of keeping the animal safe and secure. A number of native tarsier-friendly trees have been replanted on land which had been cleared previously for fruit tree and coconut [tree planting] tree planting .

Kiwi Kiwi ( [/ˈkiːwiː/] / ˈ ˈ k k iː iː w w iː iː /  [KEE-wee] KEE KEE -wee ) are [flightless birds] flightless birds  [endemic] endemic to [New Zealand] New Zealand of the [order] order  Apterygiformes Apterygiformes . The five extant species fall into the family Apterygidae Apterygidae ( [/ˌæptəˈrɪdʒədiː/] / ˌ ˌ æ æ p p t t ə ə ˈ ˈ r r ɪ ɪ dʒ dʒ ə ə d d iː iː / ) and genus Apteryx Apteryx Apteryx ( [/ˈæptərɪks/] / ˈ ˈ æ æ p p t t ər ər ɪ ɪ k k s s / ). Approximately the size of a [domestic chicken] domestic chicken , kiwi are the smallest [ratites] ratites (which also include [ostriches] ostriches , [emus] emus , [rheas] rheas , [cassowaries] cassowaries and the extinct [elephant birds] elephant birds and [moa] moa ).
DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy [elephant birds] elephant birds than to the [moa] moa with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, four of which are currently listed as [vulnerable] vulnerable , and [one] one of which is [near threatened] near threatened . All species have been negatively affected by historic [deforestation] deforestation , but their remaining habitat is well protected in large forest reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by [invasive] invasive mammalian predators.
The vestigial wings are so small as to be invisible under their bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. Kiwi eggs are one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any order of bird in the world. Other unique [adaptations] adaptations of kiwi, such as short and stout legs and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well known.
The kiwi is recognised as an [icon of New Zealand] icon of New Zealand , and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi [Kiwi] Kiwi is used internationally as the colloquial [demonym] demonym for New Zealanders. 
== Etymology ==
The [Māori language] Māori language word kiwi kiwi kiwi is generally accepted to be ""of imitative origin"" from the [call] call . However, some linguists derive the word from [Proto-Nuclear Polynesian] Proto-Nuclear Polynesian  * kiwi kiwi , which refers to Numenius tahitiensis Numenius tahitiensis , the [bristle-thighed curlew] bristle-thighed curlew , a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands. With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the newfound bird. The bird's name is spelled with a lower-case k k and, being a word of [Māori] Māori origin, normally stays as kiwi kiwi when [pluralised] pluralised . 
The genus name Apteryx Apteryx is derived from [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek 'without wing': a- a- a- ( ἀ- ἀ- ἀ- ), 'without' or 'not'; ptéryx ptéryx ptéryx ( πτέρυξ πτέρυξ πτέρυξ ), 'wing'. 
== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Although it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites, the [moa] moa , recent [DNA studies] DNA studies have identified its closest relative as the extinct [elephant bird] elephant bird of [Madagascar] Madagascar , and among extant ratites, the kiwi is more closely related to the [emu] emu and the [cassowaries] cassowaries than to the moa. 
Research published in 2013 on an extinct genus, Proapteryx [Proapteryx] Proapteryx , known from the [Miocene] Miocene deposits of the [Saint Bathans Fauna] Saint Bathans Fauna , found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight, supporting the hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas, which were already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared. 
=== Species ===
There are five known species of kiwi, with a number of subspecies.
A. haastii [A. haastii] A. haastii 
A. owenii [A. owenii] A. owenii 
A. australis [A. australis] A. australis

Relationships in the genus Apteryx Apteryx 

== Description ==
Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other [ratites] ratites ( [ostrich] ostrich , [emu] emu , [rhea] rhea and [cassowary] cassowary ), they have no [keel] keel on the [sternum] sternum to anchor wing muscles. The [vestigial] vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have [marrow] marrow , like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as 450 g (16 oz). Like most other ratites, they have no [uropygial gland] uropygial gland ( [preen] preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced [pecten] pecten . Their feathers lack [barbules] barbules and [aftershafts] aftershafts , and they have large [vibrissae] vibrissae around the [gape] gape . They have 13 [flight feathers] flight feathers , no tail and a small [pygostyle] pygostyle . Their [gizzard] gizzard is weak and their [caecum] caecum is long and narrow. 
The eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species, resulting in the smallest visual field as well. The eye has small specialisations for a [nocturnal] nocturnal lifestyle, but kiwi rely more heavily on their other senses (auditory, olfactory, and [somatosensory system] somatosensory system ). The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature, showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging. In an experiment, it was observed that one-third of a population of A. rowi A. rowi in New Zealand under no environmental stress had ocular lesions in one or both eyes. The same experiment examined three specific specimens that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular abnormalities. A 2018 study revealed that the kiwi's closest relatives, the extinct [elephant birds] elephant birds , also shared this trait despite their great size. 
Unlike virtually every other [palaeognath] palaeognath , which are generally small-brained by bird standards, kiwi have proportionally large [encephalisation quotients] encephalisation quotients . Hemisphere proportions are even similar to those of [parrots] parrots and [songbirds] songbirds , though there is no evidence of similarly complex behaviour. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Before the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were [three species of bat] three species of bat , and the [ecological niches] ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles, insects and gastropods). 
The kiwi's mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate [podocarp] podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them. This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that A. australis A. australis can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues. 
Once bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20 years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of [ovaries] ovaries . (In most birds and in [platypuses] platypuses , the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional. )
Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays one of the largest eggs in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii A. haastii , in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92 days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast. 
It was believed that the large eggs were a trait of much larger [moa] moa -like ancestors, and that kiwi retained large eggs as an evolutionarily neutral trait as they became smaller. However, research in the early 2010s suggested that kiwi were descended from smaller flighted birds that flew to New Zealand and Madagascar, where they gave rise to kiwi and elephant birds. The large egg is instead thought to be an adaptation for [precocity] precocity , enabling kiwi chicks to hatch mobile and with yolk to sustain them for two and half weeks. The large eggs would be safe in New Zealand's historical absence of egg-eating ground predators, while the mobile chicks would be able to evade chick-eating flying predators. 
[Lice] Lice in the genus Apterygon [Apterygon] Apterygon and in the subgenus Rallicola [Rallicola] Rallicola ( Aptericola Aptericola ) are exclusively [ectoparasites] ectoparasites of kiwi species. 
== Status and conservation ==
Nationwide studies show that only around 5–10% of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood without management. As of 2018 over 70% of kiwi populations are unmanaged. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint [1080 poison] 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the [Animal Health Board] Animal Health Board in [Tongariro] Tongariro Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. 57% of the radio-tagged chicks survived to adulthood. 
Efforts to protect kiwi have had some success, and in 2017 two species were downlisted from endangered to vulnerable by the IUCN. In 2018 the [Department of Conservation] Department of Conservation released its current Kiwi Conservation Plan. 
=== Sanctuaries ===
In 2000, the [Department of Conservation] Department of Conservation set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers. 
A number of other [mainland conservation islands] mainland conservation islands and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi, including:
North Island brown kiwi were introduced to the [Cape Sanctuary] Cape Sanctuary in [Hawke's Bay] Hawke's Bay between 2008 and 2011, which in turn provided captive-raised chicks that were released back into Maungataniwha Native Forest. 
Sanctuaries for kiwi are also referred to as 'kōhanga sites' from the Māori word for 'nest' or 'nursery'. 
=== Operation Nest Egg ===

Operation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust—a partnership between the [Bank of New Zealand] Bank of New Zealand , the Department of Conservation and the [Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society] Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society . Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves—usually when they weigh around 1200 grams (42 ounces). They are then returned to the wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthood—compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and -raised chicks. The tool is used on all kiwi species except [little spotted kiwi] little spotted kiwi .
=== 1080 poison ===
In 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public. He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Extensive monitoring shows that kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison. 
=== Threats ===
[Introduced mammalian predators] Introduced mammalian predators , namely stoats, dogs, ferrets, and cats, are the principal threats to kiwi. The biggest threat to kiwi chicks is stoats, while dogs are the biggest threat to adult kiwi.  [Stoats] Stoats are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand. Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about 1–1.2 kg (2.2–2.6 lb) in weight, at which time they can usually defend themselves. Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks. These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the distinctive strong scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track, such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set [possum] possum traps often kill or maim kiwi. 
Habitat destruction is another major threat to kiwi; restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding. Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality (accidents, etc.) results in less than 5% of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood. 
== Relationship to humans ==
The [Māori] Māori traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of [Tāne Mahuta] Tāne Mahuta , god of the forest. They were used as food and their feathers were used for [kahu kiwi] kahu kiwi —ceremonial cloaks. Today, while kiwi feathers are still used, they are gathered from birds that die naturally, through road accidents, or predation, and from captive birds. Kiwi are no longer hunted and some Māori consider themselves the birds' guardians. 
=== Scientific documentation ===
In 1813, [George Shaw] George Shaw named the genus Apteryx Apteryx in his [species description] species description of the southern brown kiwi, which he called ""the southern apteryx"". Captain Andrew Barclay of the ship Providence [Providence] Providence provided Shaw with the specimen. Shaw's description was accompanied by two plates, engraved by [Frederick Polydore Nodder] Frederick Polydore Nodder ; they were published in volume 24 of The Naturalist's Miscellany The Naturalist's Miscellany . 
=== Zoos ===
In 1851, [London Zoo] London Zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi. The first captive breeding took place in 1945. As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi. The [Frankfurt Zoo] Frankfurt Zoo has 12, the [Berlin Zoo] Berlin Zoo has seven, [Walsrode Bird Park] Walsrode Bird Park has one, the [Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands] Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands has three, the [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo has five, the [San Diego Zoo Safari Park] San Diego Zoo Safari Park has one, the [National Zoo in Washington, DC] National Zoo in Washington, DC has eleven, the [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute] Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has one, and the [Columbus Zoo and Aquarium] Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has three. 
In 2023, [Zoo Miami] Zoo Miami apologized for mistreating a kiwi, after footage of visitors patting the nocturnal bird under bright lights caused outrage in New Zealand. 
=== As a national symbol ===
The kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges. It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887. Soon after, the kiwi appeared in many military badges; and in 1906, when [Kiwi Shoe Polish] Kiwi Shoe Polish was widely sold in the UK and the US, the symbol became more widely known. 
During the First World War, the name ""Kiwis"" for New Zealand soldiers came into general use, and a giant kiwi (now known as the [Bulford kiwi] Bulford kiwi ) was carved on the chalk hill above [Sling Camp] Sling Camp in England. Usage has become so widespread that all New Zealanders overseas and at home are now commonly referred to as "" [Kiwis] Kiwis "". 
The kiwi has since become the best-known national symbol for New Zealand, and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms, crests and badges of many New Zealand cities, clubs and organisations. At the national level, the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the centre of the [roundel] roundel of the [Royal New Zealand Air Force] Royal New Zealand Air Force . The kiwi is featured in the logo of the [New Zealand Rugby League] New Zealand Rugby League , and the [New Zealand national rugby league team] New Zealand national rugby league team are nicknamed the Kiwis.
A kiwi has featured on the reverse side of three New Zealand coins: the one florin (two-shilling) coin from 1933 to 1966, the twenty-cent coin from 1967 to 1990, and the one-dollar coin since 1991. In [currency trading] currency trading the [New Zealand dollar] New Zealand dollar is often referred to as ""the kiwi"". 
=== In popular culture ===
A song, ""Sticky Beak the Kiwi"", with words by Bob Edwards and music by Neil Roberts, was recorded in 1961, sung by Julie Nelson (aged 14) and accompanied by the Satins and the Don Bell Orchestra of [Whangārei] Whangārei . A Christmas song, it portrays Sticky Beak as insisting on pulling Santa Claus's sleigh when distributing presents south of the equator. 
""How the Kiwi Lost its Wings"" is a fable written by broadcaster Alwyn Owen in 1963. It uses elements of Māori mythology, such as [Tāne Mahuta] Tāne Mahuta , and the World War I symbol of cowardice, [white feathers] white feathers , in a [pourquoi story] pourquoi story explaining features of New Zealand birds. Owen portrays the kiwi as nobly sacrificing its wings and flight in order to protect the trees from depredation by ground-dwelling creatures, and thereby winning its unique renown. Owen's story is sometimes described as ""A Maori Legend"". It has been recorded as a children's story, published as a book, was made into an animated film in 1980, set to music for the [Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra] Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra by Thomas Goss as ""Tāne and the Kiwi"" in 2002 (recorded for [RNZ] RNZ by [Orchestra Wellington] Orchestra Wellington in 2008 ), and performed as a ballet by the [Royal New Zealand Ballet] Royal New Zealand Ballet in 2022.

Aye-aye,Aye-aye,"
Species:
The aye-aye aye-aye ( Daubentonia madagascariensis Daubentonia madagascariensis Daubentonia madagascariensis ) is a long-fingered [lemur] lemur , a [strepsirrhine] strepsirrhine  [primate] primate native to [Madagascar] Madagascar with [rodent] rodent -like teeth that perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger that they can use to catch grubs and larvae out of tree trunks.
It is the world's largest [nocturnal] nocturnal primate. It is characterized by its unusual method of finding food: it taps on trees to find [grubs] grubs , then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward-slanting incisors to create a small hole into which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. This foraging method is called percussive foraging percussive foraging , and takes up 5–41% of foraging time. The only other living mammal species known to find food in this way are the [striped possum] striped possum and trioks (genus Dactylopsila [Dactylopsila] Dactylopsila ) of northern Australia and New Guinea, which are marsupials. From an ecological point of view, the aye-aye fills the niche of a [woodpecker] woodpecker , as it is capable of penetrating wood to extract the invertebrates within. 
The aye-aye is the only [extant] extant member of the [genus] genus  Daubentonia [Daubentonia] Daubentonia and [family] family Daubentoniidae.  It is currently classified as [Endangered] Endangered by the [IUCN] IUCN . A second species, Daubentonia robusta [Daubentonia robusta] Daubentonia robusta , appears to have become [extinct] extinct at some point within the last 1000 years, and is known from [subfossil] subfossil finds. 
== Etymology ==
The genus Daubentonia Daubentonia was named after the French naturalist [Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton] Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton by his student, [Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire] Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire , in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name Scolecophagus Scolecophagus (""worm-eater"") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered. In 1863, British zoologist [John Edward Gray] John Edward Gray coined the family name Daubentoniidae. 
The French naturalist [Pierre Sonnerat] Pierre Sonnerat was the first to use the vernacular name "" aye-aye aye-aye "" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the "" long-fingered lemur long-fingered lemur "" by English zoologist [George Shaw] George Shaw in 1800—a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name ""aye-aye"" was a "" cri d'exclamation & d'étonnement cri d'exclamation & d'étonnement cri d'exclamation & d'étonnement "" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [Ian Tattersall] Ian Tattersall noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [Malagasy] Malagasy name ""hai hai"" or ""hay hay"", (also ahay ahay , aiay [aiay] aiay , haihay haihay ) which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel et al. et al. (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from "" heh heh heh heh "", which is Malagasy for ""I don't know"". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying "" heh heh heh heh "" to [avoid saying the name] avoid saying the name of a feared, magical animal. 
== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==
Due to its [derived] derived  [morphological] morphological features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [incisors] incisors (front teeth) parallels those of [rodents] rodents , leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [Rodentia] Rodentia and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils. 
The aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain.  It has been considered a highly derived member of the family [Indridae] Indridae , a [basally diverging] basally diverging branch of the [strepsirrhine] strepsirrhine suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates. In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes Chiromyiformes , a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [Colin Groves] Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a [clade] clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs. 
However, molecular results have consistently placed Daubentonia Daubentonia as the most [basal] basal ly diverging of [lemurs] lemurs . The most parsimonious explanation for this is that all lemurs are derived from a single ancestor that [rafted] rafted from Africa to Madagascar during the [Paleogene] Paleogene . Similarities in dentition between aye-ayes and several African primate fossils ( Plesiopithecus [Plesiopithecus] Plesiopithecus and Propotto [Propotto] Propotto ) have led to the alternate theory that the ancestors of aye-ayes colonized Madagascar separately from other lemurs. In 2008, [Russell Mittermeier] Russell Mittermeier , Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae. 
Further evidence indicating that the aye-aye belongs in the superfamily [Lemuroidea] Lemuroidea can be inferred from the presence of [petrosal] petrosal bullae encasing the [ossicles] ossicles of the ear. The aye-ayes are also similar to lemurs in their shorter back legs. 
== Anatomy and morphology ==
A full-grown aye-aye is typically about 60 centimetres (2 feet) long with a tail longer than its body. The species has an average head and body length of 36–43 cm (14–17 in) plus a tail of 56–61 cm (22–24 in), and weighs around 2 kilograms (4 pounds). 
Young aye-ayes typically are silver colored on their front and have a stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.
Among the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers. The third finger, which is much thinner than the others, is used for extracting grubs and insects out of trees, using the hooked nail. The finger is unique in the animal kingdom in that it possesses a ball-and-socket [metacarpophalangeal joint] metacarpophalangeal joint , can reach the throat through a [nostril] nostril and is used for [picking one's nose] picking one's nose and [eating mucus] eating mucus ( [mucophagy] mucophagy ) so harvested from inside the nose. The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a [pseudothumb] pseudothumb , to aid in gripping. 
The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of aye-aye ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals from the tapping of its finger, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a [Fresnel lens] Fresnel lens , and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as [lesser galago] lesser galago , [bat-eared fox] bat-eared fox , [mouse lemur] mouse lemur , and others.
Females have two nipples located in the region of the groin. The male's genitalia are similar to those of [canids] canids , with a large [prostate] prostate and long [baculum] baculum . 
== Behaviour and lifestyle ==
The aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate. 
Mating season extends throughout the year, with females typically starting to breed at the age of three or four. They give birth to one offspring every two to three years. During the period of parenting, a female becomes the dominant figure over males, likely to secure better access to food while caring for her young. The infant remains in a nest for up to two months before venturing out, but it takes another seven months before the young aye-aye can maneuver the canopy as skillfully as an adult. 
=== Diet and foraging ===
The aye-aye is an [omnivore] omnivore and commonly eats seeds, nuts, fruits, nectar, plant exudates and fungi, but also xylophagous, or wood boring, insect larvae (especially [cerambycid beetle] cerambycid beetle larvae) and honey. Aye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers. The aye-aye begins [foraging] foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 4 km ( 2 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 mi) a night. 
Though foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups. Individual movements within the group are coordinated using both vocalisations and scent signals. 
=== Social systems ===
The aye-aye is classically considered 'solitary' as they have not been observed to groom each other. However, recent research suggests that it is more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to 32 hectares (80 acres), while females have smaller living spaces that go up to 8.1 hectares (20 acres). It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this. Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory. 
Like many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging. The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [echolocation] echolocation to find its prey. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
The aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [rainforest] rainforest or [dry deciduous forest] dry deciduous forest , but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built from interwoven twigs and dead leaves up in the canopy among the vines and branches. 
== Conservation ==
The aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. In 1966, nine individuals were transported to [Nosy Mangabe] Nosy Mangabe , an island near [Maroantsetra] Maroantsetra off eastern Madagascar. Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to [endangered] endangered in 2014. This is for four main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil by local cultures, and is killed as such. The forests of Madagascar are declining in range due to [deforestation] deforestation . Local farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops; aye-aye [poaching] poaching is another major issue. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest aye-ayes pose any legitimate threat to crops and therefore are killed based on superstition. 
As many as 50 aye-ayes can be found in zoological facilities worldwide. 
=== Folk belief ===
The aye-aye is often viewed as a harbinger of evil and death and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The [Sakalava] Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle fingers to puncture their victims' [aorta] aorta . 
=== Captive breeding ===
The conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the [Duke Lemur Center] Duke Lemur Center in [Durham, North Carolina] Durham, North Carolina . This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy. They have also revolutionized the understanding of the aye-aye diet.

Echidnas Echidnas ( [/ɪˈkɪdnəz/] / ɪ ɪ ˈ ˈ k k ɪ ɪ d d n n ə ə z z / ), sometimes known as spiny anteaters spiny anteaters , are quill-covered  [monotremes] monotremes (egg-laying [mammals] mammals ) belonging to the [family] family  Tachyglossidae Tachyglossidae  [/tækiˈɡlɒsɪdiː/] / t t æ æ k k i i ˈ ˈ ɡ ɡ l l ɒ ɒ s s ɪ ɪ d d iː iː / , living in [Australia] Australia and [New Guinea] New Guinea . The four [extant] extant species of echidnas and the [platypus] platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the [order] order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the American [true anteaters] true anteaters or to [hedgehogs] hedgehogs . Their young are called puggles puggles .
Echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago, descending from a [platypus] platypus -like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land. 
== Etymology ==
Echidnas are possibly named after [Echidna] Echidna , a creature from [Greek mythology] Greek mythology who was half-woman, half-snake, as the animal was perceived to have qualities of both mammals and reptiles. An alternative explanation is a confusion with Ancient Greek: ἐχῖνος ἐχῖνος [ἐχῖνος] ἐχῖνος , romanized: romanized: ekhînos ekhînos ekhînos , lit. lit.  'hedgehog, sea urchin'. 
== Physical characteristics ==
Echidnas are medium-sized, solitary mammals covered with coarse hair and [spines] spines . The spines are modified hairs and are made of [keratin] keratin , the same fibrous protein that makes up fur, claws, nails, and horn sheaths in animals. 
Superficially, they resemble the anteaters of South America and other spiny mammals such as [hedgehogs] hedgehogs and [porcupines] porcupines . They are usually black or brown in coloration. There have been several reports of [albino] albino echidnas with pink eyes and white spines. They have elongated and slender snouts that function as both mouth and nose, and which have [electrosensors] electrosensors to find earthworms, termites, ants, and other burrowing prey. This is similar to the [platypus] platypus , which has 40,000 electroreceptors on its bill, but the long-beaked echidna has only 2,000, while the short-beaked echidna, which lives in a drier environment, has no more than 400 at the tip of its snout. 
Echidnas have short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. Their hind claws are elongated and curved backwards to aid in digging. Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws, and feed by tearing open soft logs, [anthills] anthills and the like, and licking off prey with their long, sticky tongues. The ears are slits on the sides of their heads under the spines. The [external ear] external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle. At 33 °C (91.4 °F), echidnas also possess the second-lowest active body temperature of all mammals, behind the platypus.
Despite their appearance, echidnas are capable swimmers, as they evolved from [platypus-like ancestors] platypus-like ancestors . When swimming, they expose their snout and some of their spines, and are known to journey to water to bathe. 
The first European drawing of an echidna was made in [Adventure Bay, Tasmania] Adventure Bay, Tasmania by [HMSProvidence] HMS Providence Providence 's third lieutenant [George Tobin] George Tobin during [William Bligh] William Bligh 's second breadfruit voyage. 
== Diet ==
The [short-beaked echidna] short-beaked echidna 's diet consists mostly of ants and termites, while the Zaglossus Zaglossus (long-beaked) species typically eat worms and insect larvae. The tongues of [long-beaked echidnas] long-beaked echidnas have sharp, tiny spines that help them capture their prey. They have no teeth, so they break down their food by grinding it between the bottoms of their mouths and their tongues. Echidnas' [faeces] faeces are 7 cm (3 in) long and are cylindrical in shape; they are usually broken and unrounded, and composed largely of dirt and ant-hill material. 
Like all mammals, echidnas feed their young on milk, which contains various factors to sustain their growth and development. 
== Habitat ==
Echidnas do not tolerate extreme temperatures; they shelter from harsh weather in caves and rock crevices. Echidnas are found in forests and woodlands, hiding under vegetation, roots or piles of debris. They sometimes use the burrows (both abandoned and in use) of animals such as rabbits and [wombats] wombats . Individual echidnas have large, mutually overlapping territories. 
== Anatomy ==
Echidnas and platypuses are the only egg-laying mammals, the [monotremes] monotremes .
The average lifespan of an echidna in the wild is estimated at 14–16 years. Fully grown females can weigh about 4.5 kilograms (9.9 lb), the males 33% larger, at about 6 kilograms (13 lb). Though the internal reproductive organs differ, both sexes possess an identical single [cloaca] cloaca opening for urination, defecation, and mating. 
Male echidnas have non-venomous [spurs] spurs on the hind feet, similar to the venomous male platypus. 
Due to their low [metabolism] metabolism and accompanying stress resistance, echidnas are long-lived for their size; the longest recorded lifespan for a captive echidna is 50 years, with anecdotal accounts of wild individuals reaching 45 years. 
The echidna's brain is half [neocortex] neocortex , compared to 80% of a human brain. Contrary to previous research, the echidna does enter [REM] REM sleep, but only in a comfortable temperature around 25 °C (77 °F). At lower or higher temperatures of 15 °C (59 °F) and 28 °C (82 °F), REM sleep is suppressed. 
== Reproduction ==
The female lays a single soft-shelled, leathery egg 22 days after mating, and deposits it directly into her pouch. An egg weighs 1.5 to 2 grams (0.05 to 0.07 oz) and is about 1.4 centimetres (0.55 in) long. While [hatching] hatching , the baby echidna opens the leather shell with a reptile-like [egg tooth] egg tooth . Hatching takes place after 10 days of [gestation] gestation ; the young echidna, called a puggle, born larval and fetus-like, then sucks [milk] milk from the [pores] pores of the two [milk patches] milk patches (monotremes have no [teats] teats ) and remains in the pouch for 45 to 55 days, at which time it starts to develop spines. The mother digs a nursery burrow and deposits the young, returning every five days to suckle it until it is weaned at seven months. Puggles will stay within their mother's den for up to a year before leaving.
Male echidnas have a four-headed penis. During mating, the heads on one side ""shut down"" and do not grow in size; the other two are used to release semen into the female's two-branched reproductive tract. Each time it [copulates] copulates , it alternates heads in sets of two. When not in use, the penis is retracted inside a [preputial] preputial sac in the cloaca. The male echidna's penis is 7 centimetres (2.8 in) long when erect, and its shaft is covered with [penile spines] penile spines . These may be used to [induce ovulation] induce ovulation in the female. 
It is a challenge to study the echidna in its natural habitat, and they show no interest in mating while in captivity. Prior to 2007, no one had ever seen an echidna ejaculate. There have been previous attempts, trying to force the echidna to ejaculate through the use of [electrically stimulated ejaculation] electrically stimulated ejaculation in order to [obtain semen samples] obtain semen samples but this has only resulted in the penis swelling. 
[Breeding season] Breeding season begins in late June and extends through September. During mating season, a female may be followed by a line or ""train"" of up to ten males, the youngest trailing last, and some males switching between lines. 
== Threats ==
Echidnas are very timid. When frightened, they attempt to partially bury themselves and curl into a ball similar to a [hedgehog] hedgehog . Strong front arms allow echidnas to dig in and hold fast against a predator pulling them from the hole.
Their many predators include [feral cats] feral cats , [foxes] foxes , [domestic dogs] domestic dogs , and [goannas] goannas . Snakes pose a large threat when they slither into echidna burrows and prey on the spineless young puggles.
They are easily stressed and injured by handling. Some ways to help echidnas include picking up litter, causing less pollution, planting vegetation for shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas, and leaving them undisturbed. 
== Evolution ==
The divergence between oviparous (egg-laying) and viviparous (offspring develop internally) mammals is believed to date to the [Triassic] Triassic period. Most findings from genetics studies (especially of nuclear genes) are in agreement with the paleontological dating, but some other evidence, like mitochondrial DNA, give slightly different dates. 
[Molecular clock] Molecular clock data suggest echidnas split from platypuses between 19 and 48 million years ago, so that [platypus-like fossils] platypus-like fossils dating back to over 112.5 million years ago represent [basal] basal forms, rather than close relatives of the modern platypus. This would imply that echidnas evolved from [water-foraging ancestors that returned to land living] water-foraging ancestors that returned to land living , which put them in competition with marsupials. Although extant monotremes lack adult teeth (platypuses have teeth only as juveniles), many extinct monotreme species have been identified based on the morphology of their teeth. Of the eight genes involved in tooth development, four have been lost in both platypus and echidna, indicating that the loss of teeth occurred before the echidna-platypus split. 
Further evidence of [water-foraging ancestors] water-foraging ancestors can be found in some of the echidna's anatomy, including [hydrodynamic] hydrodynamic streamlining, dorsally projecting hind limbs acting as rudders, and locomotion founded on hypertrophied humeral long-axis rotation, which provides an efficient swimming stroke. 
[Oviparous] Oviparous reproduction in monotremes may give them an advantage over [marsupials] marsupials in some environments. Their observed adaptive radiation contradicts the assumption that monotremes are frozen in morphological and [molecular evolution] molecular evolution .
It has been suggested that echidnas originally evolved in [New Guinea] New Guinea when it was isolated from Australia and from marsupials. This would explain their rarity in the fossil record, their abundance in present times in New Guinea, and their original adaptation to terrestrial niches, presumably without competition from marsupials.

The three living Zaglossus Zaglossus species are [endemic] endemic to [New Guinea] New Guinea . They are rare and are hunted for food. They forage in [leaf litter] leaf litter on the [forest floor] forest floor , eating [earthworms] earthworms and [insects] insects . The species are
=== Tachyglossus ===
The [short-beaked echidna] short-beaked echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus Tachyglossus aculeatus ) is found in southern, southeast and northeast [New Guinea] New Guinea , and also occurs in almost all Australian environments, from the snow-clad [Australian Alps] Australian Alps to the deep deserts of the [Outback] Outback , essentially anywhere ants and termites are available. It is smaller than the Zaglossus Zaglossus species, and it has longer hair.
Despite the similar dietary habits and methods of consumption to those of an anteater, there is no evidence supporting the idea that echidna-like monotremes have been myrmecophagic (ant or termite-eating) since the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous . The fossil evidence of invertebrate-feeding [bandicoots] bandicoots and rat-kangaroos, from around the time of the platypus–echidna [divergence] divergence and pre-dating Tachyglossus Tachyglossus , show evidence that echidnas expanded into new ecospace despite competition from marsupials.

Platypus,Platypus,"
The platypus platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus Ornithorhynchus anatinus Ornithorhynchus anatinus ), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus duck-billed platypus , is a [semiaquatic] semiaquatic , egg-laying [mammal] mammal endemic to [eastern Australia] eastern Australia , including [Tasmania] Tasmania . The platypus is the sole living representative or [monotypic taxon] monotypic taxon of its [family] family  [Ornithorhynchidae] Ornithorhynchidae and [genus] genus  Ornithorhynchus Ornithorhynchus , though a number of [related species] related species appear in the fossil record.
Together with the four species of [echidna] echidna , it is one of the five [extant] extant species of [monotremes] monotremes , mammals that lay [eggs] eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Like other monotremes, the platypus has a sense of [electrolocation] electrolocation , which it uses to detect prey in cloudy water. It is one of the few species of [venomous mammals] venomous mammals , as the male platypus has a [spur] spur on the hind foot that delivers an extremely painful [venom] venom .
The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, [duck] duck -billed, [beaver] beaver -tailed, [otter] otter -footed mammal at first baffled European naturalists. In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake made of several animals sewn together.
The unique features of the platypus make it important in the study of [evolutionary biology] evolutionary biology , and a recognisable and iconic symbol of [Australia] Australia . It is culturally significant to several [Aboriginal peoples] Aboriginal peoples , who also used to hunt it for food. It has appeared as a national mascot, features on the [reverse] reverse of the [Australian twenty-cent coin] Australian twenty-cent coin , and is an emblem of the state of [New South Wales] New South Wales .
The platypus was hunted for its fur, but it has been a legally [protected species] protected species in all states where it occurs since 1912. Its population is not under severe threat, although [captive-breeding] captive-breeding programs have had slight success, and it is vulnerable to pollution. It is classified as a [near-threatened species] near-threatened species by the [IUCN] IUCN , but a November 2020 report has recommended that it be upgraded to [threatened species] threatened species under the federal EPBC Act [EPBC Act] EPBC Act , due to [habitat destruction] habitat destruction and declining numbers in all states. 
== Taxonomy and naming ==
[Australian Aboriginal people] Australian Aboriginal people name or have named the platypus in various ways depending on [Australian indigenous languages and dialects] Australian indigenous languages and dialects . Among the names found: boondaburra boondaburra , mallingong mallingong , tambreet tambreet , watjarang watjarang (names in [Yass] Yass , [Murrumbidgee] Murrumbidgee , and [Tumut] Tumut ),  tohunbuck tohunbuck (region of [Goomburra] Goomburra , [Darling Downs] Darling Downs ),  dulaiwarrung dulaiwarrung ou dulai warrung dulai warrung ( [Woiwurrung] Woiwurrung language, [Wurundjeri] Wurundjeri , [Victoria] Victoria ),  djanbang djanbang ( [Bundjalung] Bundjalung , [Queensland] Queensland ),  djumulung djumulung ( [Yuin] Yuin language, [Yuin] Yuin , [New South Wales] New South Wales ),  maluŋgaŋ maluŋgaŋ (ngunnawal language, [Ngunnawal] Ngunnawal , [Australian Capital Territory] Australian Capital Territory ), biladurang biladurang , wamul wamul , dyiimalung dyiimalung , oornie oornie , dungidany dungidany ( [Wiradjuri] Wiradjuri language, [Wiradjuri] Wiradjuri , [Vic] Vic , [NSW] NSW ),  oonah oonah , etc. The name chosen and approved in [Palawa kani] Palawa kani (reconstructed [tasmanian] tasmanian language) is larila larila . 
When the platypus was first encountered by Europeans in 1798, a [pelt] pelt and sketch were sent back to [Great Britain] Great Britain by [Captain John Hunter] Captain John Hunter , the second Governor of [New South Wales] New South Wales . British scientists' initial hunch was that the attributes were a hoax.  [George Shaw] George Shaw , who produced the first description of the animal in the Naturalist's Miscellany Naturalist's Miscellany in 1799, stated it was impossible not to entertain doubts as to its genuine nature, and [Robert Knox] Robert Knox believed it might have been produced by some Asian [taxidermist] taxidermist . It was thought somebody had sewn a duck's beak onto the body of a beaver-like animal. Shaw even took a pair of scissors to the dried skin to check for stitches. 
The common name ""platypus"" literally means 'flat-foot', deriving from the [Greek] Greek word platúpous platúpous platúpous ( πλατύπους [πλατύπους] πλατύπους ), from platús platús platús ( πλατύς [πλατύς] πλατύς 'broad, wide, flat') and poús poús poús ( πούς [πούς] πούς 'foot'). Shaw initially assigned the species the [Linnaean] Linnaean name Platypus anatinus Platypus anatinus when he described it, but the genus term was quickly discovered to already be in use as the name of the wood-boring [ambrosia beetle] ambrosia beetle genus Platypus [Platypus] Platypus . It was independently described as Ornithorhynchus paradoxus Ornithorhynchus paradoxus by [Johann Blumenbach] Johann Blumenbach in 1800 (from a specimen given to him by [Sir Joseph Banks] Sir Joseph Banks ) and following the [rules of priority] rules of priority of nomenclature, it was later officially recognised as Ornithorhynchus anatinus Ornithorhynchus anatinus . 
There is no universally agreed plural form of ""platypus"" in the English language. Scientists generally use ""platypuses"" or simply ""platypus"". Alternatively, the term ""platypi"" is also used for the plural, although this is a form of [pseudo-Latin] pseudo-Latin ; going by the word's Greek roots the plural would be ""platypodes"". Early [British] British  [settlers] settlers called it by many names, such as ""watermole"", ""duckbill"", and ""duckmole"". Occasionally it is specifically called the ""duck-billed platypus"".
The scientific name Ornithorhynchus anatinus Ornithorhynchus anatinus literally means 'duck-like bird-snout', deriving its [genus name] genus name from the Greek root ornith- ornith- ornith- ( όρνιθ [όρνιθ] όρνιθ  ornith ornith or ὄρνις ὄρνις ὄρνις  órnīs órnīs 'bird') and the word rhúnkhos rhúnkhos rhúnkhos ( ῥύγχος [ῥύγχος] ῥύγχος 'snout', 'beak'). Its [species name] species name is derived from Latin anatinus [anatinus] anatinus ('duck-like') from anas [anas] anas 'duck'. The platypus is the sole living representative or monotypic taxon of its [family] family (Ornithorhynchidae). 
== Description ==
In [David Collins] David Collins 's account of the new colony 1788–1801, he describes ""an amphibious animal, of the mole species"", with a drawing. 
The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown, biofluorescent [fur] fur that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm. The fur is waterproof, and textured like that of a [mole] mole . The platypus's tail stores fat reserves, an adaptation also found in the [Tasmanian devil] Tasmanian devil .  [Webbing] Webbing is more significant on the front feet, which in land walking are folded up in [knuckle-walking] knuckle-walking to protect the webbing. The elongated snout and lower jaw are covered in soft skin, forming the bill. The nostrils are located on the snout's dorsal surface, while the eyes and ears are just behind the snout in a groove which closes underwater. Platypuses can give a low growl when disturbed, and a range of vocalisations have been reported in captivity. 
Size varies considerably in different regions, with average weight from 0.7 to 2.4 kg (1 lb 9 oz to 5 lb 5 oz); males have average length 50 cm (20 in), while females are the smaller at 43 cm (17 in). This variation does not seem to follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other factors such as predation and human encroachment. 
The platypus has an average [body temperature] body temperature of about 32 °C (90 °F), lower than the 37 °C (99 °F) typical of [placental mammals] placental mammals . Research suggests this has been a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions among the few marginal surviving monotreme species, rather than a general characteristic of past monotremes. 
In addition to laying eggs, the anatomy, [ontogeny] ontogeny , and genetics of monotremes shows traces of similarity to reptiles and birds. The platypus has a [reptilian] reptilian gait with legs on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. The platypus's genes are a possible evolutionary link between the mammalian [XY] XY and bird/reptile [ZW] ZW sex-determination systems, as one of the platypus's five X chromosomes contains the [DMRT1] DMRT1 gene, which birds possess on their Z chromosome. 
As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in the [middle ear] middle ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in pre-mammalian [synapsids] synapsids . However, the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an [interclavicle] interclavicle not found in other mammals. As in many other aquatic and semiaquatic [vertebrates] vertebrates , the bones show [osteosclerosis] osteosclerosis , increasing their density to provide ballast. 
The platypus [jaw] jaw is constructed differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw-opening muscle is different. Modern platypus young have three teeth in each of the [maxillae] maxillae (one premolar and two [molars] molars ) and [dentaries] dentaries (three molars), which they lose before or just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults instead develop heavily [keratinised] keratinised food-grinding pads called [ceratodontes] ceratodontes . The first upper and third lower cheek teeth of platypus nestlings are small, each having one principal cusp, while the other teeth have two main cusps. 
=== Venom ===
While both male and female platypuses are born with back ankle spurs, only the males' deliver venom. It is powerful enough to kill smaller animals such as dogs, and though it is not lethal to humans, it can inflict weeks of agony.  [Edema] Edema rapidly develops around the wound and gradually spreads through the affected limb, and it may develop into an excruciating [hyperalgesia] hyperalgesia (heightened sensitivity to pain) persisting for days or even months. 
The venom is composed largely of [defensin] defensin -like [proteins] proteins (DLPs) produced by the immune system, three of which are unique to the platypus. In other animals, defensins [kill] kill pathogenic bacteria and viruses, but in platypuses they are also collected into a venom against predators. Venom is produced in the [crural] crural glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped [alveolar glands] alveolar glands connected by a thin-walled duct to a [calcaneus] calcaneus spur on each hind limb. The female platypus, in common with echidnas, has rudimentary spur buds that do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first year) and lack functional crural glands. Venom production rises among males during the breeding season, and it may be used to assert dominance. 
Similar spurs are found on many archaic mammal groups, indicating that this was an ancient general characteristic among mammals. 
=== Electrolocation ===
[Monotremes] Monotremes are the only mammals (apart from the [Guiana dolphin] Guiana dolphin ) known to have a sense of [electroreception] electroreception , and the platypus's electroreception is the most sensitive of any monotreme. Feeding by neither sight nor smell, the platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose when it dives. Digging in the bottom of streams with its bill, its electroreceptors detect tiny electric currents generated by the muscular contractions of its prey, enabling it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects. Experiments have shown the platypus will even react to an ""artificial shrimp"" if a small electric current is passed through it. 
The [electroreceptors] electroreceptors are located in rostrocaudal rows in the skin of the bill, while [mechanoreceptors] mechanoreceptors for touch are uniformly distributed across the bill. The electrosensory area of the [cerebral cortex] cerebral cortex is in the tactile [somatosensory] somatosensory area, and some cortical cells receive input from both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting the platypus feels electric fields like touches. These receptors in the bill dominate the [somatotopic map] somatotopic map of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the [Penfield homunculus map] Penfield homunculus map . 
The platypus can feel the direction of an electric source, perhaps by comparing differences in [signal strength] signal strength across the sheet of electroreceptors, enhanced by the characteristic side-to-side motion of the animal's head while hunting. It may also be able to determine the distance of moving prey from the time lag between their electrical and mechanical pressure pulses. 
Monotreme electrolocation for hunting in murky waters may be tied to their tooth loss. The extinct Obdurodon [Obdurodon] Obdurodon was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus it foraged [pelagically] pelagically . 
=== Eyes ===
In recent studies it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of [Pacific hagfish] Pacific hagfish or Northern Hemisphere [lampreys] lampreys than to those of most tetrapods. The eyes also contain [double cones] double cones , unlike most mammals. 
Although the platypus's eyes are small and not used under water, several features indicate that vision was important for its ancestors. The [corneal] corneal surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat, while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A [temporal] temporal (ear side) concentration of [retinal ganglion cells] retinal ganglion cells , important for binocular vision, indicates a vestigial role in [predation] predation , though the actual visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Limited acuity is matched by low [cortical magnification] cortical magnification , a small [lateral geniculate nucleus] lateral geniculate nucleus , and a large [optic tectum] optic tectum , suggesting that the [visual midbrain] visual midbrain plays a more important role than the [visual cortex] visual cortex , as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system. This contrasts with the small number of electroreceptors in the [short-beaked echidna] short-beaked echidna , which dwells in dry environments, while the [long-beaked echidna] long-beaked echidna , which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes. 
=== Biofluorescence ===
In 2020, research revealed that platypus fur gives a bluish-green [biofluorescent] biofluorescent glow in [black light] black light . 
== Distribution, ecology, and behaviour ==
The platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of [Tasmania] Tasmania and the [Australian Alps] Australian Alps to the [tropical rainforests] tropical rainforests of coastal [Queensland] Queensland as far north as the base of the [Cape York Peninsula] Cape York Peninsula . 
Inland, its distribution is not well known. It was considered extinct on the [South Australian] South Australian mainland, with the last sighting recorded at [Renmark] Renmark in 1975. In the 1980s, [John Wamsley] John Wamsley created a platypus breeding program in [Warrawong Sanctuary] Warrawong Sanctuary (see [below] below ), which subsequently closed. In 2017 there were some unconfirmed sightings downstream from the sanctuary, and in October 2020 a nesting platypus was filmed inside the recently reopened sanctuary. 
There is a population on [Kangaroo Island] Kangaroo Island introduced in the 1920s, said to stand at 150 individuals in the Rocky River region of [Flinders Chase National Park] Flinders Chase National Park . In the [2019–20 Australian bushfire season] 2019–20 Australian bushfire season , large portions of the island burnt, decimating wildlife. However, [SA Department for Environment and Water] SA Department for Environment and Water recovery teams worked to reinstate their habitat, with a number of sightings reported by April 2020. 
The platypus is no longer found in the main [Murray–Darling Basin] Murray–Darling Basin , possibly due to declining [water quality] water quality from land clearing and [irrigation] irrigation although it is found in the [Goulburn River] Goulburn River in Victoria. Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable: absent in some relatively healthy rivers, but present in some quite degraded ones, for example the lower [Maribyrnong] Maribyrnong . 
In captivity, platypuses have survived to 30 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 24 years old. [Mortality rates] Mortality rates for adults in the wild appear to be low. Natural predators include [snakes] snakes , [water rats] water rats , [goannas] goannas , [hawks] hawks , [owls] owls , and [eagles] eagles . Low platypus numbers in northern Australia are possibly due to predation by [crocodiles] crocodiles . The introduction of [red foxes] red foxes in 1845 for sport hunting may have had some impact on its numbers on the mainland. The platypus is generally [nocturnal] nocturnal and [crepuscular] crepuscular , but can be active on overcast days. Its habitat bridges [rivers] rivers and the [riparian zone] riparian zone , where it finds both prey and river banks to dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a range of up to 7 km (4.3 mi), with a male's home range overlapping those of three or four females. 
The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the water foraging for food. It has a swimming style unique among mammals, propelling itself by alternate strokes of the front feet, while the webbed hind feet are held against the body and only used for steering, along with the tail. It can maintain its relatively low body temperature of about 32   °C (90   °F) while foraging for hours in water below 5   °C (41   °F). Dives normally last around 30 seconds, with an estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds, with 10 to 20 seconds at the surface between dives. 
The platypus rests in a short, straight burrow in the riverbank about 30 cm (12 in) above water level, its oval entrance-hole often [hidden] hidden under a tangle of roots. It may sleep up to 14 hours per day, after half a day of diving. 
=== Diet ===
The platypus is a [carnivore] carnivore , feeding on [annelid] annelid worms, [insect larvae] insect larvae , freshwater [shrimp] shrimp , and [yabby] yabby ( [crayfish] crayfish ) that it digs out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming. It carries prey to the surface in cheek-pouches before eating it. It eats about 20% of its own weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours daily looking for food. 
=== Reproduction ===
The species has a single [breeding season] breeding season between June and October, with some local variation. Investigations have found both resident and transient platypuses, and suggest a [polygynous] polygynous mating system. Females are believed to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding observed in animals over nine years old. During [copulation] copulation , the male grasps the female's tail with his bill, wraps his tail around her, then grips her neck or shoulder, everts his [penis] penis through his [cloaca] cloaca , and inserts it into her [urogenital sinus] urogenital sinus . He takes no part in nesting, living in his year-long resting burrow. After mating, the female constructs a deep, elaborate nesting burrow up to 20 m (65 ft) long. She tucks fallen leaves and reeds underneath her curled tail, dragging them to the burrow to soften the tunnel floor with folded wet leaves, and to line the nest at the end with bedding. 
The female has two [ovaries] ovaries , but only the left one is functional. She lays one to three (usually two) small, leathery eggs (similar to those of reptiles), about .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 11 mm ( 7 7 ⁄ 16 16 in) in diameter and slightly rounder than bird eggs. The eggs develop in utero [in utero] in utero for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external [incubation] incubation (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). The female curls around the incubating eggs, which develop in three phases. In the first, the [embryo] embryo has no functional organs and relies on the [yolk sac] yolk sac for sustenance, until the sac is absorbed. During the second phase, the digits develop, and in the last phase, the [egg tooth] egg tooth appears. At first, European [naturalists] naturalists could hardly believe that the female platypus lays eggs, but this was finally confirmed by [William Hay Caldwell] William Hay Caldwell in 1884. 
Most mammal zygotes go through [holoblastic] holoblastic cleavage, splitting into multiple divisible daughter cells. However, [monotremes] monotremes like the platypus, along with [reptiles and birds] reptiles and birds , undergo meroblastic cleavage, in which the ovum does not split completely. The cells at the edge of the yolk remain continuous with the egg's cytoplasm, allowing the yolk and embryo to exchange waste and nutrients with the egg through the cytoplasm. 
Young platypus are called ""puggles"". Newly hatched platypuses are vulnerable, blind, and hairless, and are fed by the mother's milk, that provides all the requirements for growth and development. The platypus's [mammary glands] mammary glands lack [teats] teats , with milk released through pores in the skin. The milk pools in grooves on the mother's abdomen, allowing the young to lap it up. After they hatch, the offspring are milk-fed for three to four months.
During incubation and weaning, the mother initially leaves the burrow only for short periods to forage. She leaves behind her a number of thin soil plugs along the length of the burrow, possibly to protect the young from predators; pushing past these on her return squeezes water from her fur and allows the burrow to remain dry. After about five weeks, the mother begins to spend more time away from her young, and at around four months, the young emerge from the burrow. A platypus is born with teeth, but these drop out at a very early age, leaving the horny plates it uses to grind food. 
== Evolution ==
Platypus Platypus 
[Echidnas] Echidnas 
[Marsupials] Marsupials 
[Placentals] Placentals 
The platypus and other monotremes were very poorly understood, and some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them – for example, that the monotremes were ""inferior"" or [quasireptilian] quasireptilian – still endure. In 1947, [William King Gregory] William King Gregory theorised that placental mammals and marsupials may have diverged earlier, and a subsequent branching divided the monotremes and marsupials, but later research and fossil discoveries have suggested this is incorrect. In fact, modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree, and a later branching is thought to have led to the [marsupial] marsupial and placental groups.  [Molecular clock] Molecular clock and fossil dating suggest platypuses split from [echidnas] echidnas around 19–48   million years ago. 
The oldest discovered fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago during the [Quaternary] Quaternary period, though a limb bone of Ornithorhynchus Ornithorhynchus is known from [Pliocene] Pliocene -aged strata. The extinct monotremes Teinolophos [Teinolophos] Teinolophos and Steropodon [Steropodon] Steropodon from the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but are now considered more basal taxa. The fossilised Steropodon Steropodon was discovered in [New South Wales] New South Wales and is composed of an opalised lower jawbone with three molar teeth (whereas the adult contemporary platypus is toothless). The molar teeth were initially thought to be [tribosphenic] tribosphenic , which would have supported a variation of Gregory's theory, but later research has suggested, while they have three cusps, they evolved under a separate process. The fossil jaw of Teinolophos Teinolophos is thought to be about 110   million years old, making it the oldest mammal fossil found in Australia. Unlike the modern platypus (and [echidnas] echidnas ), Teinolophos Teinolophos lacked a beak. 
In 2024, [Late Cretaceous] Late Cretaceous ( [Cenomanian] Cenomanian )-aged fossil specimens of actual early platypus relatives were recovered from the same rocks as Steropodon Steropodon , including the [basal] basal  Opalios [Opalios] Opalios and the more derived Dharragarra [Dharragarra] Dharragarra , the latter of which may be the oldest member of the platypus [stem] stem -lineage, as it retains the same [dental formula] dental formula found in Cenozoic platypus relatives.  Monotrematum [Monotrematum] Monotrematum and Patagorhynchus [Patagorhynchus] Patagorhynchus , two other fossil relatives of the platypus, are known from the latest Cretaceous ( [Maastrichtian] Maastrichtian ) and the mid- [Paleocene] Paleocene of [Argentina] Argentina , indicating that some monotremes managed to colonize [South America] South America from Australia when the two continents were connected via [Antarctica] Antarctica . These are also considered potential members of the platypus stem-lineage. The closest fossil relative of the platypus was Obdurodon [Obdurodon] Obdurodon , known from the late [Oligocene] Oligocene to the [Miocene] Miocene of Australia. It closely resembled the modern platypus, aside from the presence of molar teeth. A fossilised tooth of the giant platypus Obdurodon tharalkooschild [Obdurodon tharalkooschild] Obdurodon tharalkooschild was dated 5–15   million years ago. Judging by the tooth, the animal measured 1.3 metres long, making it the largest platypus on record. 
The loss of teeth in the modern platypus has long been enigmatic, as a distinctive lower molar tooth row was previously present in its lineage for over 95 million years. Even its closest relative, Obdurodon Obdurodon , which otherwise closely resembles the platypus, retained this tooth row. More recent studies indicate that this tooth loss was a geologically very recent event, occurring only around the [Plio] Plio - [Pleistocene] Pleistocene (around 2.5 million years ago), when the [rakali] rakali , a large semiaquatic [rodent] rodent , colonized Australia from [New Guinea] New Guinea . The platypus, which previously fed on a wide array of hard and soft-bodied prey, was outcompeted by the rakali over hard-bodied prey such as crayfish and mussels. This competition may have selected for the loss of teeth in the platypus and their replacement by horny pads, as a way of specializing for softer-bodied prey, which the rakali did not compete with it over. 
=== Genome ===
Because of the early divergence from the [therian mammals] therian mammals and the low numbers of extant monotreme species, the platypus is a frequent subject of research in evolutionary biology. In 2004, [researchers] researchers at the [Australian National University] Australian National University discovered the platypus has ten [sex chromosomes] sex chromosomes , compared with two (XY) in most other mammals. These ten chromosomes form five unique pairs of XY in males and XX in females, i.e. males are X 1 1 Y 1 1 X 2 2 Y 2 2 X 3 3 Y 3 3 X 4 4 Y 4 4 X 5 5 Y 5 5 . One of the X chromosomes of the platypus has great homology to the bird Z chromosome. The platypus genome also has both reptilian and mammalian genes associated with egg fertilisation. Though the platypus lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene [SRY] SRY , a study found that the mechanism of sex determination is the [AMH gene] AMH gene on the oldest [Y chromosome] Y chromosome . A draft version of the platypus genome sequence was published in Nature [Nature] Nature on 8   May 2008, revealing both reptilian and mammalian elements, as well as two genes found previously only in birds, amphibians, and fish. More than 80% of the platypus's genes are common to the other mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. An updated genome, the most complete on record, was published in 2021, together with the genome of the [short-beaked echidna] short-beaked echidna . 
== Conservation ==
=== Status and threats ===
Except for its loss from the state of South Australia, the platypus occupies the same general distribution as it did prior to [European settlement of Australia] European settlement of Australia . However, local changes and fragmentation of distribution due to human modification of its habitat are documented. Its historical abundance is unknown and its current abundance difficult to gauge, but it is assumed to have declined in numbers, although as of 1998 was still being considered as common over most of its current range. The species was extensively hunted for its fur until the early years of the 20th century. Although the species gained legal protections beginning in Victoria in 1890 and throughout Australia by 1912, until about 1950 it was still at risk of drowning in the nets of inland [fisheries] fisheries . 
The [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature recategorised its status as ""near threatened"" in 2016. The species is protected by law, but the only state in which it is listed as endangered is South Australia, under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 [National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972] National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 . In November 2020 a recommendation was made to list the platypus as a vulnerable species across all states with a vulnerable listing being made official in Victoria under the state's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 [Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988] Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 on 10 January 2021. 
The platypus is not considered to be in immediate danger of extinction, because conservation measures have been successful, but it could be adversely affected by habitat disruption caused by [dams] dams , [irrigation] irrigation , [pollution] pollution , netting, and trapping. Reduction of watercourse flows and water levels through excessive droughts and extraction of water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic supplies are also considered a threat. The [IUCN] IUCN lists the platypus on its [Red List] Red List as "" [Near Threatened] Near Threatened "" as assessed in 2016, when it was estimated that numbers had reduced by about 30 percent on average since European settlement. The animal is listed as endangered in South Australia, but it is not covered at all under the federal EPBC Act [EPBC Act] EPBC Act . 
Researchers have worried for years that declines have been greater than assumed. In January 2020, researchers from the [University of New South Wales] University of New South Wales presented evidence that the platypus is at risk of [extinction] extinction , due to a combination of extraction of [water resources] water resources , [land clearing] land clearing , [climate change] climate change and severe [drought] drought . The study predicted that, considering current threats, the animals' abundance would decline by 47–66% and [metapopulation] metapopulation occupancy by 22–32% over 50 years, causing ""extinction of local populations across about 40% of the range"". Under projections of climate change projections to 2070, reduced habitat due to drought would lead to 51–73% reduced abundance and 36–56% reduced metapopulation occupancy within 50 years respectively. These predictions suggested that the species would fall under the ""Vulnerable"" classification. The authors stressed the need for national conservation efforts, which might include conducting more surveys, tracking trends, reduction of threats and improvement of river management to ensure healthy platypus habitat. Co-author Gilad Bino is concerned that the estimates of the 2016 baseline numbers could be wrong, and numbers may have been reduced by as much as half already. 
A November 2020 report by scientists from the [University of New South Wales] University of New South Wales , funded by a research grant from the [Australian Conservation Foundation] Australian Conservation Foundation in collaboration with the [World Wildlife Fund Australia] World Wildlife Fund Australia and the [Humane Society International Australia] Humane Society International Australia revealed that that platypus habitat in Australia had shrunk by 22 per cent in the previous 30 years, and recommended that the platypus should be listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act EPBC Act . Declines in population had been greatest in NSW, in particular in the [Murray–Darling basin] Murray–Darling basin . 
Platypuses generally suffer from few [diseases] diseases in the wild; however, as of 2008 there was concern in Tasmania about the potential impacts of a disease caused by the fungus Mucor amphibiorum [Mucor amphibiorum] Mucor amphibiorum . The disease (termed [mucormycosis] mucormycosis ) affects only Tasmanian platypuses, and had not been observed in platypuses in mainland Australia. Affected platypuses can develop skin lesions or [ulcers] ulcers on various parts of their bodies, including their backs, tails, and legs. Mucormycosis can kill platypuses, death arising from secondary infection and by affecting the animals' ability to maintain body temperature and forage efficiently. The Biodiversity Conservation Branch at the Department of Primary Industries and Water collaborated with NRM north and [University of Tasmania] University of Tasmania researchers to determine the impacts of the disease on Tasmanian platypuses, as well as the mechanism of transmission and spread of the disease. 
=== Wildlife sanctuaries ===
Much of the world was introduced to the platypus in 1939 when National Geographic Magazine [National Geographic Magazine] National Geographic Magazine published an article on the platypus and the efforts to study and raise it in captivity. The latter is a difficult task, and only a few young have been successfully raised since, notably at [Healesville Sanctuary] Healesville Sanctuary in [Victoria] Victoria . The leading figure in these efforts was [David Fleay] David Fleay , who established a platypusary (a simulated stream in a tank) at the Healesville Sanctuary, where breeding was successful in 1943. In 1972, he found a dead baby of about 50 days old, which had presumably been born in captivity, at his [wildlife park] wildlife park at [Burleigh Heads] Burleigh Heads on the [Gold Coast] Gold Coast , Queensland. Healesville repeated its success in 1998 and again in 2000 with a similar stream tank. Since 2008, platypus has bred regularly at Healesville, including second-generation (captive born themselves breeding in captivity).  [Taronga Zoo] Taronga Zoo in [Sydney] Sydney bred twins in 2003, and breeding was again successful there in 2006. 
=== Captivity ===
As of 2019, the only platypuses in captivity outside of Australia are in the [San Diego Zoo Safari Park] San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the [U.S. state] U.S. state of [California] California . Three attempts were made to bring the animals to the [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo , in 1922, 1947, and 1958. Of these, only two of the three animals introduced in 1947, [Penelope] Penelope and Cecil, lived longer than eighteen months. 
== Human interactions ==
=== Usage ===
[Aboriginal Australians] Aboriginal Australians used to hunt platypuses for food (their fatty tails being particularly nutritious), while, after colonisation, Europeans hunted them for fur from the late 19th century until 1912, when it was prohibited by law. In addition, European researchers captured and killed platypus or removed their eggs, partly in order to increase scientific knowledge, but also to gain prestige and outcompete rivals from different countries. 
=== Cultural references ===
The platypus has been a subject in the [Dreamtime] Dreamtime stories of [Aboriginal Australians] Aboriginal Australians , some of whom believed the animal was a hybrid of a duck and a [water rat] water rat . 
According to one story of the upper [Darling River] Darling River , the major animal groups, the land animals, water animals and birds, all competed for the platypus to join their respective groups, but the platypus ultimately decided to not join any of them, feeling that he did not need to be part of a group to be special, and wished to remain friends with all of those groups. Another Dreaming story emanate of the upper Darling tells of a young duck which ventured too far, ignoring the warnings of her tribe, and was kidnapped by a large water-rat called Biggoon. After managing to escape after some time, she returned and laid two eggs which hatched into strange furry creatures, so they were all banished and went to live in the mountains. 
The platypus is also used by some Aboriginal peoples as a [totem] totem , which is to them ""a natural object, plant or animal that is inherited by members of a clan or family as their spiritual emblem"", and the animal holds special meaning as a totem animal for the [Wadi Wadi] Wadi Wadi people, who live along the [Murray River] Murray River . Because of their cultural significance and importance in [connection to country] connection to country , the platypus is protected and conserved by these Indigenous peoples. 
The platypus has often been used as a symbol of Australia's [cultural identity] cultural identity . In the 1940s, live platypuses were given to allies in the [Second World War] Second World War , in order to strengthen ties and boost morale. 
Platypuses have been used several times as mascots: Syd the platypus was one of the three mascots chosen for the [Sydney 2000 summer Olympics] Sydney 2000 summer Olympics along with an echidna and a [kookaburra] kookaburra , Expo Oz the platypus was the mascot for [World Expo 88] World Expo 88 , which was held in [Brisbane] Brisbane in 1988, and Hexley the platypus is the mascot for the [Darwin] Darwin operating system, the [BSD] BSD -based core of [macOS] macOS and other operating systems from [Apple Inc.] Apple Inc. 
Since the introduction of [decimal currency] decimal currency to [Australia] Australia in 1966, the embossed image of a platypus, designed and sculpted by [Stuart Devlin] Stuart Devlin , has appeared on the reverse (tails) side of the [20-cent coin] 20-cent coin . The platypus has frequently appeared in Australian postage stamps, most recently the 2015 ""Native Animals"" series and the 2016 ""Australian Animals Monotremes"" series. 
In the American animated series Phineas and Ferb [Phineas and Ferb] Phineas and Ferb , the [title characters] title characters own a pet bluish-green platypus named [Perry] Perry who, unknown to them, is a secret agent. Such choices were inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance; additionally, show creator [Dan Povenmire] Dan Povenmire , who also wrote the character's theme song, said that its opening lyrics are based on the introductory sentence of the Platypus article on Wikipedia, copying the ""semiaquatic egg-laying mammal"" phrase word for word and appending the phrase ""of action""; however, the article did not include ""egg-laying mammal"" in the lead sentence until 2014, several years after the song released. As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics. Coincidentally, real platypuses show a similar cyan colour when seen under ultraviolet lighting.

The maned wolf maned wolf ( Chrysocyon brachyurus Chrysocyon brachyurus Chrysocyon brachyurus ) is a large [canine] canine of [South America] South America . It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay, and is almost extinct in Uruguay. Its markings resemble those of [foxes] foxes , but it is neither a fox nor a [wolf] wolf . It is the only [species] species in the [genus] genus  Chrysocyon Chrysocyon Chrysocyon (meaning ""golden dog"" in [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek : χρῡσο-κύων χρῡσο-κύων : chryso-kyōn).
It is the largest canine in [South America] South America , weighing 20–30 kg (44–66 lb) and up to 110 cm (43 in) at the [withers] withers . Its long, thin legs and dense reddish coat give it a distinct appearance. The maned wolf is a [crepuscular] crepuscular and [omnivorous] omnivorous animal adapted to the open environments of the South American [savanna] savanna , with an important role in the [seed dispersal] seed dispersal of fruits, especially the [wolf apple] wolf apple ( Solanum lycocarpum Solanum lycocarpum ). The maned wolf is a solitary animal. It communicates primarily by [scent marking] scent marking , but also gives a loud call known as ""roar-barking"".
This [mammal] mammal lives in open and semi-open [habitats] habitats , especially [grasslands] grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the [Cerrado] Cerrado of south, central-west, and southeastern [Brazil] Brazil ; [Paraguay] Paraguay ; northern [Argentina] Argentina ; and [Bolivia] Bolivia east and north of the [Andes] Andes , and far southeastern [Peru] Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It is very rare in [Uruguay] Uruguay , possibly being displaced completely through loss of habitat. The [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as [near threatened] near threatened , while it is considered a [vulnerable species] vulnerable species by the [Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources] Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources . In 2011, a female maned wolf, run over by a truck, underwent [stem cell] stem cell treatment at the [Zoo Brasília] Zoo Brasília [ [pt] pt ] , this being the first recorded case of the use of stem cells to heal injuries in a wild animal. 
== Etymology ==
The term maned wolf is an allusion to the mane of the nape. It is known locally as aguara guasu aguara guasu aguara guasu (meaning ""large fox"") in the [Guarani language] Guarani language , or kalak kalak in the [Toba Qom language] Toba Qom language , lobo-guará lobo-guará lobo-guará in Portuguese, and lobo de crín lobo de crín lobo de crín , lobo de los esteros lobo de los esteros lobo de los esteros , or lobo colorado lobo colorado lobo colorado in Spanish. The term lobo lobo , ""wolf"", originates from the Latin lupus lupus lupus . Guará Guará and aguará aguará originated from Tupi-Guarani agoa'rá agoa'rá , ""by the fuzz"".  It also is called borochi borochi in Bolivia. 
== Taxonomy ==
Although the maned wolf displays many fox-like characteristics, it is not closely related to [foxes] foxes . It lacks the elliptical [pupils] pupils found distinctively in foxes. The maned wolf's evolutionary relationship to the other members of the [canid] canid family makes it a unique animal.
[Electrophoretic] Electrophoretic studies did not link Chrysocyon Chrysocyon with any of the other living canids studied. One conclusion of this study is that the maned wolf is the only species among the large South American canids that survived the late [Pleistocene extinction] Pleistocene extinction . Fossils of the maned wolf from the [Holocene] Holocene and the [late Pleistocene] late Pleistocene have been excavated from the [Brazilian Highlands] Brazilian Highlands . 
A 2003 study on the brain anatomy of several canids placed the maned wolf together with the [Falkland Islands wolf] Falkland Islands wolf and with pseudo-foxes of the genus Pseudalopex [Pseudalopex] Pseudalopex . One study based on [DNA] DNA evidence  showed that the [extinct] extinct genus Dusicyon [Dusicyon] Dusicyon , comprising the Falkland Islands wolf and its mainland relative, was the most closely related species to the maned wolf in historical times, and that about seven million years ago it shared a common ancestor with that genus. A 2015 study reported genetic signatures in maned wolves that are indicative of population expansion followed by contraction that took place during [Pleistocene] Pleistocene  [interglaciations] interglaciations about 24,000 years before present. 
The maned wolf is not closely related to canids found outside South America. It is not a fox, wolf, [coyote] coyote or [jackal] jackal , but a distinct canid; though, based only on morphological similarities, it previously had been placed in the Canis [Canis] Canis and Vulpes [Vulpes] Vulpes genera. Its closest living relative is the [bush dog] bush dog (genus Speothos [Speothos] Speothos ), and it has a more distant relationship to other South American canines (the [short-eared dog] short-eared dog , the [crab-eating fox] crab-eating fox , and the zorros or Lycalopex [Lycalopex] Lycalopex ).

== Description ==
The species was described in 1815 by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, initially as Canis brachyurus Canis brachyurus . Lorenz Oken classified it as Vulpes cancosa Vulpes cancosa , and only in 1839 did Charles Hamilton Smith describe the genus Chrysocyon Chrysocyon . Other authors later considered it as a member of the Canis Canis genus. Fossils of Chrysocyon Chrysocyon dated from the Late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs were collected in one of [Peter Wilheim Lund] Peter Wilheim Lund expeditions to [Lagoa Santa] Lagoa Santa , Minas Gerais (Brazil). The specimen is kept in the South American Collection of the [Zoologisk Museum] Zoologisk Museum in Denmark. Since no other record exists of fossils in other areas, the species is suggested to have evolved in this geographic region. 
The maned wolf bears minor similarities to the [red fox] red fox , although it belongs to a different genus. The average adult weighs 23 kg (51 lb) and stands up to 110 cm (43 in) tall at the shoulder, and  has a head-body length of 100 cm (39 in), with the tail adding another 45 cm (18 in). Its ears are large and long 18 cm (7.1 in). 
The maned wolf is the tallest of the wild canids; its long legs are likely an adaptation to the tall grasslands of its native habitat. Fur of the maned wolf may be reddish-brown to golden orange on the sides with long, black legs, and a distinctive black [mane] mane . The coat is marked further with a whitish tuft at the tip of the tail and a white ""bib"" beneath the throat. The mane is erectile and typically is used to enlarge the wolf's profile when threatened or when displaying aggression. Melanistic maned wolves do exist, but are rare. The first photograph of a black adult maned wolf was taken by a camera trap in northern [Minas Gerais] Minas Gerais in Brazil in 2013. 
The skull can be identified by its reduced [carnassials] carnassials , small upper incisors, and long canine teeth. Like other canids, it has 42 teeth with the [dental formula] dental formula  3.1.4.2 3.1.4.2 3.1.4.3 3.1.4.3 × 2 = 42 . The maned wolf's [rhinarium] rhinarium extends to the upper lip, similar to the [bush dog] bush dog , but its [vibrissae] vibrissae are longer. The skull also features a prominent [sagittal crest] sagittal crest .
The maned wolf's footprints are similar to those of the [dog] dog , but have disproportionately small plantar pads when compared to the well-opened digit marks. The dog has pads up to three times larger than the maned wolf's footprint. These pillows have a triangular shape. The front footprints are 7–9 cm (2.8–3.5 in) long and 5.5–7 cm (2.2–2.8 in) wide, and those of the hind feet are 6.5–9 cm (2.6–3.5 in) long and 6.5–8.5 cm (2.6–3.3 in) wide. One feature that differentiates the maned wolf's footprint from those of other South American canids is the proximal union of the third and fourth digits. 
The maned wolf also is known for the distinctive [cannabis] cannabis -like odor of its territory markings, which has earned it the nickname ""skunk wolf"".
=== Genetics ===
Genetically, the maned wolf has 37 pairs of [autosomes] autosomes within diploid genes, with a [karyotype] karyotype similar to that of other canids.  It has 76 chromosomes, so cannot interbreed with other canids. Evidence suggests that 15,000 years ago, the species suffered a reduction in its [genetic diversity] genetic diversity , called the [bottleneck effect] bottleneck effect . However, its diversity is still greater than that of other canids. 
== Ecology and behavior ==
=== Hunting and territoriality ===
The maned wolf is a twilight animal, but its activity pattern is more related to the relative humidity and temperature, similar to that observed with the [bush dog] bush dog ( Speothos venaticus Speothos venaticus ). Peak activity occurs between 8 and 10 am, and 8 and 10 pm. On cold or cloudy days, they can be active all day. The species is likely to use open fields for foraging and more closed areas, such as [riparian forests] riparian forests , to rest, especially on warmer days. 
Unlike most large canids (such as the [gray wolf] gray wolf , the [African hunting dog] African hunting dog , or the [dhole] dhole ), the maned wolf is a solitary animal and does not form [packs] packs . It typically hunts alone, usually between sundown and midnight, rotating its large ears to listen for prey animals in the grass. It taps the ground with a front foot to flush out the prey and pounce to catch it. It kills prey by biting on the neck or back, and shaking the prey violently if necessary. 
Monogamous pairs may defend a shared territory around 30 km (12 sq mi), although outside of mating, the individuals may meet only rarely. The territory is crisscrossed by paths that they create as they patrol at night. Several adults may congregate in the presence of a plentiful food source, for example, a fire-cleared patch of grassland that would leave small vertebrate prey exposed while foraging.
Both female and male maned wolves [use their urine to communicate] use their urine to communicate , e.g. to mark their hunting paths or the places where they have buried hunted prey. The urine has a very distinctive odor, which some people liken to [hops] hops or [cannabis] cannabis . The responsible substance very likely is a [pyrazine] pyrazine , which also occurs in both plants. At the [Rotterdam Zoo] Rotterdam Zoo , this smell once set the police on a hunt for cannabis smokers. The preferred habitat of the maned wolf includes grasslands, scrub prairies, and forests.
=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Their mating season ranges from November to April. [Gestation] Gestation lasts 60 to 65 days, and a litter may have from two to six black-furred pups, each weighing roughly 450 g (16 oz). Pups are fully grown when one year old. During that first year, the pups rely on their parents for food. 
Data on the maned wolf's estrus and reproductive cycle mainly come from captive animals, particularly about breeding endocrinology. Hormonal changes of maned wolves in the wild follow the same variation pattern of those in captivity. Females [ovulate] ovulate spontaneously, but some authors suggest that the presence of a male is important for estrus induction. 
Captive animals in the Northern Hemisphere breed between October and February and in the Southern Hemisphere between August and October. This indicates that [photoperiod] photoperiod plays an important role in maned wolf reproduction, mainly due to the production of [semen] semen . Generally, one [estrus] estrus occurs per year. The amount of sperm produced by the maned wolf is lower compared to those of other canids. 
[Copulation] Copulation occurs during the four-day estrus period, and lasts up to 15 minutes. Courtship is similar to that of other [canids] canids , characterized by frequent approaches and [anogenital] anogenital investigation. 
[Gestation] Gestation lasts 60 to 65 days and a litter may have from two to six pups. One litter of seven has been recorded. Birthing has been observed in May in the [Canastra Mountains] Canastra Mountains , but data from captive animals suggest that births are concentrated between June and September. The maned wolf reproduces with difficulty in the wild, with a high rate of infant mortality. Females can go up to two years without breeding. Breeding in captivity is even more difficult, especially in temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. 
Pups are born weighing between 340 and 430 grams. They begin their lives with black fur, becoming red after 10 weeks. The eyes open at about 9 days of age. They are nursed up to 4 months. Afterwards, they are fed by their parents by [regurgitation] regurgitation , starting on the third week of age and lasting up to 10 months. Three-month-old pups begin to accompany their mother while she [forages] forages . Males and females both engage in parental care, but it is primarily done by the females. Data on male parental care have been collected from captive animals, and little is known whether this occurs frequently in the wild. Maned wolves reach sexual maturity at one year of age, when they leave their birth territory. 
The maned wolf's longevity in the wild is unknown, but estimates in captivity are between 12 and 15 years. A report was made of an individual at the [São Paulo Zoo] São Paulo Zoo that lived to be 22 years old. 
=== Diet ===
The maned wolf is omnivorous. It specialises in preying on small and medium-sized animals, including small mammals (typically [rodents] rodents and [rabbits] rabbits ), [birds] birds and their [eggs] eggs , [reptiles] reptiles , and even [fish] fish , [gastropods] gastropods , other terrestrial [molluscs] molluscs , and [insects] insects , but a large portion of its diet (more than 50%, according to some studies) is vegetable matter, including sugarcane, tubers, bulbs, roots and fruit. Up to 301 food items have been recorded in the maned wolf's diet, including 116 plants and 178 animal species. 
The maned wolf hunts by chasing its prey, digging holes, and jumping to catch birds in flight. About 21% of hunts are successful. Some authors have recorded active pursuits of the [Pampas deer] Pampas deer . They were also observed feeding on carcasses of run down animals. Fecal analysis has shown consumption of the [giant anteater] giant anteater , [bush dog] bush dog , and [collared peccary] collared peccary , but whether these animals are actively hunted or scavenged is not known.  [Armadillos] Armadillos are also commonly consumed. Animals are more often consumed in the dry season. 
The [wolf apple] wolf apple ( Solanum lycocarpum Solanum lycocarpum ), a tomato-like fruit, is the maned wolf's most common food item. With some exceptions, these fruits make up between 40 and 90% of the maned wolf's diet. The wolf apple is actively sought by the maned wolf, and is consumed throughout the year, unlike other fruits that can only be eaten in abundance during the rainy season. It can consume several fruits at a time and disperse intact seeds by defecating, making it an excellent disperser of the wolf apple plant. 
Despite their preferred habitat, maned wolves are ecologically flexible and can survive in disturbed habitats, from burned areas to places with high human influences. Burned areas have some small mammals, such as [hairy-tailed bolo mouse] hairy-tailed bolo mouse ( Necromys lasiurus Necromys lasiurus ) and [vesper mouse] vesper mouse ( Calomys Calomys spp.) that they can hunt and survive on. 
Historically, captive maned wolves were fed meat-heavy diets, but that caused them to develop bladder stones. Zoo diets for them now feature fruits and vegetables, as well as meat and specialized extruded diet formulated for maned wolves to be low in stone-causing compounds (i.e. cystine).
A maned wolf from Texas was found to be a host of an intestinal [acanthocephalan] acanthocephalan worm, Pachysentis canicola [Pachysentis canicola] Pachysentis canicola . 
== Relations with other species ==
The maned wolf participates in [symbiotic] symbiotic relationships. It contributes to the propagation and dissemination of the plants on which it feeds, through excretion. Often, maned wolves defecate on the nests of [leafcutter ants] leafcutter ants . The ants then use the dung to fertilize their fungus gardens, but they discard the seeds contained in the dung onto refuse piles just outside their nests. This process significantly increases the germination rate of the seeds.
Maned wolves suffer from ticks, mainly of the genus Amblyomma Amblyomma , and by flies such as Cochliomyia hominivorax Cochliomyia hominivorax usually on the ears. The maned wolf is poorly parasitized by fleas. The sharing of territory with domestic dogs results in a number of diseases, such as rabies virus, parvovirus, distemper virus, canine adenovirus, protozoan Toxoplasma gondii Toxoplasma gondii , bacterium Leptospira interrogans Leptospira interrogans , and nematode Dirofilaria immitis Dirofilaria immitis . The maned wolf is particularly susceptible to potentially fatal infection by the [giant kidney worm] giant kidney worm . Ingestion of the wolf apple could prevent maned wolves from contracting this nematode, but such a hypothesis has been questioned by several authors. 
Its predators are mainly large cats, such as the puma ( Puma concolor Puma concolor ) and the jaguar ( Panthera onca Panthera onca ), but it is most often preyed upon by the jaguar. 
=== Humans ===
Generally, the maned wolf is shy and flees when alarmed, so it poses little direct threat to humans. Popularly, the maned wolf is thought to have the potential of being a [chicken] chicken thief. It once was considered a similar threat to [cattle] cattle , [sheep] sheep , and [pigs] pigs , although this now is known to be false.
Historically, in a few parts of Brazil, these animals were hunted for some body parts, notably the eyes, that were believed to be good-luck charms.
Since its classification as a [vulnerable species] vulnerable species by the Brazilian government, it has received greater consideration and protection.
They are threatened by [habitat loss] habitat loss and being run over by automobiles. Feral and domestic dogs pass on diseases to them, and have been known to attack them.
The species occurs in several protected areas, including the national parks of Caraça and [Emas] Emas in Brazil. The maned wolf is well represented in captivity, and has been bred successfully at many zoos, particularly in Argentina, North America (part of a [Species Survival Plan] Species Survival Plan ) and Europe (part of a [European Endangered Species Programme] European Endangered Species Programme ). In 2012, a total of 3,288 maned wolves were kept at more than 300 institutions worldwide. The [Smithsonian National Zoo Park] Smithsonian National Zoo Park has been working to protect maned wolves for nearly 30 years, and coordinates the collaborative, interzoo maned wolf Species Survival Plan of North America, which includes breeding maned wolves, studying them in the wild, protecting their habitat, and educating people about them. 
The practice of hunting maned wolves is historically poorly documented, but it is speculated to be relatively frequent. This is partly because during the [Portuguese] Portuguese and [Spanish colonization] Spanish colonization of [South America] South America , Europeans projected onto the maned wolf the historical aversion they had towards [Iberian wolves] Iberian wolves , and their reputation for [eating sheep] eating sheep and other domestic animals. And even though the species is now better seen, many people consider it a potential risk to domestic birds and children.
In Brazil, the impacts of hunting on the species are better known than in Argentina, as is the impact of predation on domestic birds, which engenders retaliation from farmers. The species is also accused of attacking sheep, which increases human animosity. In Brazil, people also aimed to prevent these animals from attacking chickens, using a Brazilian variant of the [Portuguese podengo] Portuguese podengo , called the Brazilian podengo Brazilian podengo or Crioulo podengo Crioulo podengo . 
== Conservation ==
The maned wolf is not considered an endangered species by the [IUCN] IUCN because of its wide geographical distribution and adaptability to man-made environments. However, due to declining populations, it is classified as a near-threatened species. This decline is mostly due to human activities such as deforestation, increasing traffic in highways resulting in roadkill, and urban growth. Due to the decrease in their habitat, the wolves often migrate to urban regions looking for easier access to food. This increases their contact with domestic animals, as well as the risk of infectious and parasitic diseases amongst the wolves which can lead to death. 
Until 1996 the maned wolf was a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It is also listed in [CITES] CITES Appendix II, which regulates international trade in the species. The [ICMBio] ICMBio list in Brazil that follows the same IUCN criteria considers the wolf to be a vulnerable species. By these same criteria, the Brazilian state lists also consider it more problematic: it is a vulnerable species in the lists of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, while in the lists of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul the maned wolf is considered as ""endangered"" and ""critically endangered"" respectively. In Uruguay, although there is no such list as Brazil and IUCN, it is regarded as a species with ""priority"" for conservation. In Argentina it is not considered to be in critical danger, but it is recognized that its populations are declining and fragmented. The situation of the maned wolf in Bolivia and Paraguay is uncertain. Even with these uncertainties the maned wolf is protected against hunting in all countries. 
In Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay it is forbidden by law to hunt the maned wolf. Conservationists are also taking other steps to ensure its survival, especially as urbanization continues to spread in its natural habitat. 
== In human cultures ==
Human attitudes and opinions about the maned wolf vary across populations, ranging from fear and tolerance to aversion. In some regions of Brazil, parts of the animal's body are believed to help cure bronchitis, kidney disease, and even snake bites. It is also believed to bring good luck. These parts can be teeth, the heart, ears, and even dry stools. In Bolivia, mounting a saddle made of maned wolf leather is believed to protect from bad luck. Despite these superstitions, no large-scale use of parts of this animal occurs. 
In urban societies in Brazil, people tend to be sympathetic to the maned wolf, seeing no value in it as a hunting animal or pest. They often consider its preservation to be important, and although these societies associate it with force and ferocity, they do not consider it a dangerous animal. Although popular in some places and common in many zoos, it can go unnoticed. Studies in zoos in Brazil showed that up to 30% of respondents were either unaware or unable to recognize a maned wolf. 
It was considered a common animal by the [Guarani people] Guarani people , and the first names used by Europeans, such as the Spanish Jesuit missionary [Joseph of Anchieta] Joseph of Anchieta , were the same used by the native peoples ( yaguaraçú yaguaraçú ). Spanish naturalist Felix de Azara also used the Guarani name to refer to it and was one of the first to describe the biology of the species and consider it an important part of Paraguay's fauna. Much of the negative view of the maned wolf as a poultry predator stems from European ethnocentrism, where peasants often had problems with wolves and foxes. 
The maned wolf rarely causes antipathy in the human populations of the places in which it lives, so it has been used as a flag species for the preservation of the Brazilian cerrado. It is represented on the 200- [reais] reais banknote, released in September 2020. It has also been represented on the 100- [cruzeiros reais] cruzeiros reais coin, which circulated in Brazil between 1993 and 1994. 
== The urine smell of cannabis ==
Many individuals argue that specific varieties of cannabis possess a scent remarkably similar to the urine of animals like cats. However, the resemblance in the odor of maned wolf urine is even more pronounced. The intense smell of their urine could serve as an adaptation for territorial maintenance, designed to be potent enough for detection from a considerable distance. This resemblance is so striking that in 2006, authorities at Rotterdam Zoo were alerted to investigate complaints about a visitor allegedly smoking cannabis while observing the animals. / 
Drawing from knowledge about the organic compounds found in the urine of cats and dogs, it is conceivable that the source of the maned wolf's pungent urine could be a sulphur-based compound. For instance, cats feature a sulphur-containing amino acid known as felinin in their urine, contributing to olfactory communication. It is plausible that maned wolves possess a similar substance.

Proboscis Monkey,Proboscis monkey,"
The proboscis monkey proboscis monkey or long-nosed monkey long-nosed monkey ( Nasalis larvatus Nasalis larvatus Nasalis larvatus ) is an [arboreal] arboreal  [Old World monkey] Old World monkey with an unusually large nose, a reddish-brown skin color and a long tail. It is [endemic] endemic to the [southeast Asian] southeast Asian island of [Borneo] Borneo and is found mostly in [mangrove forests] mangrove forests and on the coastal areas of the island. 
This species co-exists with the [Bornean orangutan] Bornean orangutan and monkeys such as the [silvery lutung] silvery lutung . It belongs in the [monotypic] monotypic genus Nasalis Nasalis Nasalis . 
== Taxonomy ==
The proboscis monkey belongs to the subfamily [Colobinae] Colobinae of the [Old World monkeys] Old World monkeys . The two subspecies are: 
However, the difference between the subspecies is small, and not all authorities recognise N. l. orientalis N. l. orientalis . 
The genus name Nasalis Nasalis comes from the [Latin] Latin word nasus nasus meaning ""nose"". 
This animal was made known to Westerners by Baron [Friedrich von Wurmb] Friedrich von Wurmb in 1781, he later sent specimens of it to [Stamford Raffles] Stamford Raffles in Europe. 
== Description ==
The proboscis monkey is a large species, being one of the largest monkey species native to [Asia] Asia . Only the [Tibetan macaque] Tibetan macaque and a few of the [gray langurs] gray langurs can rival its size.
[Sexual dimorphism] Sexual dimorphism is pronounced in the species. Males have a head-body length of 66 to 76.2 cm (26.0 to 30.0 in) and typically weigh 16 to 22.5 kg (35 to 50 lb), with a maximum known weight of 30 kg (66 lb). Females measure 53.3 to 62 cm (21.0 to 24.4 in) in head-and-body length and weigh 7 to 12 kg (15 to 26 lb), with a maximum known mass of 15 kg (33 lb). The male has a red penis with a black scrotum. 
The proboscis monkey has a long coat; the fur on the back is bright orange, reddish brown, yellowish brown or brick-red. The underfur is light-grey, yellowish, or greyish to light-orange. Infants are born with a blue coloured face that at 2.5 months darkens to grey.  By 8.5 months of age, the face has become cream coloured like the adults. Both sexes have bulging stomachs that give the monkeys what resembles a pot belly. Many of the monkeys' toes are webbed. 
=== Nose ===
Further adding to the dimorphism is the large nose or [proboscis] proboscis of the male, which can exceed 10.2 cm (4.0 in) in length, and hangs lower than the mouth. Theories for the extensive length of their nose suggest it may be sexual selection by the females, who prefer louder vocalisations, with the size of the nose increasing the volume of the call. 
The nose is smaller in the female and is upturned in the young. Nevertheless, the nose of the female is still fairly large for a primate. The skull of the proboscis monkey has specialized [nasal cartilages] nasal cartilages that support the large nose. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The proboscis monkey is [endemic] endemic to the island of [Borneo] Borneo and can be found in all three nations that divide the island: [Brunei] Brunei , [Indonesia] Indonesia and [Malaysia] Malaysia . It is most common in coastal areas and along rivers. This species is restricted to lowland habitats that may experience tides. It favors [dipterocarp] dipterocarp , [mangrove] mangrove and [riverine] riverine forests. It can also be found in swamp forests, stunted swamp forests, rubber forests, rubber plantations, limestone hill forests, [nypa] nypa swamps, [nibong] nibong swamps, and tall swamp forests, tropical heath forests and steep cliffs. This species usually stays within at least a kilometer from a water source. It is perhaps the most [aquatic] aquatic of the primates and is a fairly good swimmer, capable of swimming up to 20 m (66 ft) underwater. It is known to swim across rivers. Aside from this, the proboscis monkey is largely arboreal and moves quadrupedally and by leaps. It is known to jump off branches and descend into water. 
== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Social behavior ===
Proboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring. All-male groups may also exist. Some individuals are solitary, mostly males. Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality, in a [fission-fusion society] fission-fusion society , with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart yet sometimes groups may join to mate and groom. Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group. One-male groups consist of 3 to 19 individuals, while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals. Serious aggression is uncommon among the monkeys but minor aggression does occur. Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females. Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression. Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups. Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid [infanticide] infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation of their social status. 
In [Sabah] Sabah , Malaysia, proboscis monkeys have been observed in mixed-species groups with [silvery lutungs] silvery lutungs , and interspecific mating and a possible hybrid has been observed. Researchers believe this may be a result of the two species being confined to a small patch of [riverine forest] riverine forest due to [deforestation] deforestation in order to plant [oil palm] oil palm trees. 
=== Reproduction ===
Females become sexually mature at the age of five years. They experience [sexual swelling] sexual swelling , which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides and shake their head from side to side. Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by subadults. Proboscis monkeys may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting, and females will attempt to initiate copulation even after they have conceived. Gestation usually last 166–200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant. When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide. 
=== Communication ===
Proboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called ""female calls"" when angry. Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and [erection] erection in males, made in the same situations. 
=== Feeding and activities ===
As a seasonal folivore and frugivore, the proboscis monkey eats primarily fruit and leaves. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent. At least 55 different plant species are consumed, ""with a marked preference for Eugenia [Eugenia] Eugenia sp., Ganua motleyana [Ganua motleyana] Ganua motleyana and Lophopetalum javanicum [Lophopetalum javanicum] Lophopetalum javanicum "". Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December. Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees. Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Their daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant. Occasionally, they chew their [cud] cud to allow more efficient digestion and food intake. As night approaches, the monkeys move back near the river and forage again. Predators (potential or confirmed) of the proboscis monkey include [crocodilians] crocodilians like [false gharials] false gharials and [saltwater crocodiles] saltwater crocodiles , the [Sunda clouded leopard] Sunda clouded leopard , [sun bears] sun bears and [reticulated pythons] reticulated pythons as well as, for probably young or sickly monkeys, large [eagles] eagles (such as the [crested serpent eagle] crested serpent eagle or [black eagle] black eagle ), large [owls] owls , and [monitor lizards] monitor lizards . Monkeys will cross rivers at narrows or cross arboreally if possible. This may serve as predator avoidance. 
== Conservation status ==
The proboscis monkey is assessed as [endangered] endangered in the [IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and listed in Appendix I of [CITES] CITES . Its total population has decreased by more than 50% in the past 36–40 years to 2008 due to ongoing [habitat loss] habitat loss because of logging and oil palm plantations, and hunting in some areas due to the species being treated as a delicacy, as well as its use in traditional Chinese medicine. The population is fragmented: the largest remaining populations are found in [Kalimantan] Kalimantan ; there are far fewer in [Sarawak] Sarawak , [Brunei] Brunei and [Sabah] Sabah . The proboscis monkey is protected by law in all regions of Borneo. In Malaysia, it is protected by a number of laws including the Wildlife Protection Act (federal law), the Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998 (Chapter 26) and Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 (Sabah state law).
The proboscis monkey can be found in 16 protected areas: [Danau Sentarum National Park] Danau Sentarum National Park , [Gunung Palung National Park] Gunung Palung National Park , Kendawangan Nature Reserve, [Kutai National Park] Kutai National Park , Lesan Protection Forest, Muara Kaman Nature Reserve, Mandor Reserve and [Tanjung Puting National Park] Tanjung Puting National Park in Indonesia; [Bako National Park] Bako National Park , Gunung Pueh Forest Reserve, Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Klias National Park, [Kulamba Wildlife Reserve] Kulamba Wildlife Reserve , Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Sungei Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary and Ulu Segama Reserve in Malaysia.

Anglerfish,Anglerfish,"
The anglerfish anglerfish are [fish] fish of the [teleost] teleost order Lophiiformes Lophiiformes ( [/ˌlɒfiɪˈfɔːrmiːz/] / ˌ ˌ l l ɒ ɒ f f i i ɪ ɪ ˈ ˈ f f ɔːr ɔːr m m iː iː z z / ). They are [bony fish] bony fish named for their characteristic mode of [predation] predation , in which a modified [luminescent] luminescent  [fin ray] fin ray (the esca or illicium) acts as a [lure] lure for other fish. The luminescence comes from symbiotic [bacteria] bacteria , which are thought to be acquired from seawater, that dwell in and around the sea.
Some anglerfish are notable for extreme [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism and sexual [symbiosis] symbiosis of the small male with the much larger female, seen in the suborder [Ceratioidei] Ceratioidei , the deep sea anglerfish. In these species, males may be several [orders of magnitude] orders of magnitude smaller than females. 
Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are [pelagic] pelagic (dwelling away from the sea floor), while others are [benthic] benthic (dwelling close to the sea floor). Some live in the deep sea (such as the [Ceratiidae] Ceratiidae ), while others live on the [continental shelf] continental shelf , such as the [frogfishes] frogfishes and the [Lophiidae] Lophiidae (monkfish or goosefish). Pelagic forms are most often [laterally] laterally compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely [dorsoventrally] dorsoventrally compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths. 
== Evolution ==
The earliest fossils of anglerfish are from the [Eocene] Eocene  [Monte Bolca] Monte Bolca formation of [Italy] Italy , and these already show significant diversification into the modern families that make up the order. Given this, and their close relationship to the [Tetraodontiformes] Tetraodontiformes , which are known from [Cretaceous] Cretaceous fossils, they likely originated during the Cretaceous. 
A 2010 [mitochondrial genome] mitochondrial genome phylogenetic study suggested the anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the early to mid-Cretaceous, between 130 and 100 million years ago. A more recent preprint reduces this time to the [Late Cretaceous] Late Cretaceous , between 92 to 61 million years ago. Other studies indicate that anglerfish only originated shortly after the [Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event] Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event as part of a massive adaptive radiation of [percomorphs] percomorphs , although this clashes with the extensive diversity already known from the group by the Eocene. A 2024 study found that all anglerfish suborders most likely diverged from one another during the [Late Cretaceous] Late Cretaceous and [Paleocene] Paleocene , but the multiple families of deep-sea anglerfishes ( [Ceratioidei] Ceratioidei ), as well as their trademark [sexual parasitism] sexual parasitism , originated during the Eocene in a rapid radiation following the [Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum] Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum . 
== Classification ==
Anglerfishes are classified by the 5th edition of Fishes of the World [Fishes of the World] Fishes of the World as set out below into 5 suborders and 18 families. The following taxa have been arranged to show their evolutionary relationships. 
The relationships of the suborders within Lophiiformes as set out in Pietsch and Grobecker's  1987 Frogfishes of the world: systematics, zoogeography, and behavioral ecology Frogfishes of the world: systematics, zoogeography, and behavioral ecology is shown below. 
Lophioidei
Antennarioidei
Chaunacoidei
Ogcocephaloidei
Ceratioidei
It has been found in [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies that both the Lophiiformes and the [Tetraodontiformes] Tetraodontiformes nest within the [Acanthuriformes] Acanthuriformes and are so classified as [clades] clades within that taxon. 
== Anatomy ==
All anglerfish are [carnivorous] carnivorous and are thus adapted for the capture of prey. Ranging in color from dark gray to dark brown, deep-sea species have large heads that bear enormous, crescent-shaped mouths full of long, fang-like teeth angled inward for efficient prey-grabbing. Their length can vary from 2–18 cm (1–7 in), with a few types getting as large as 100 cm (39 in), but this variation is largely due to sexual dimorphism, with females being much larger than males. Frogfish and other shallow-water anglerfish species are ambush predators, and often appear camouflaged as rocks, sponges or seaweed. 
Anglerfish have a flap, or the illicium, towards the distal end of their body on their first of two dorsal fins which extends to the snout and acts as a luring mechanism where prey will approach in a face-to-face manner. The illicium is moved back and forth by five distinct pairs of muscles: namely the shorter erector and depressor muscles that dictate movement of the [illicial bone] illicial bone , along with inclinator, protractor, and retractor muscles that aid motion of the [pterygiophore] pterygiophore . 
Specifically considering Cryptopsaras couesii [Cryptopsaras couesii] Cryptopsaras couesii , this deep sea [ceratioid] ceratioid anglerfish has unique rotational [biomechanics] biomechanics in its musculature. The robust retractor and protractor muscles move in a winding pattern in opposite directions along the length of the pterygiophore, which exists in a deep longitudinal ridge along the skull. Further, the long and thin inclinator of the deep sea ceratioid anglerfish allows for a distinctly wide range of [anterior] anterior and [posterior] posterior motion, assisting in the movement of the luring apparatus to aid in the ambush of prey. 
Most adult female ceratioid anglerfish have a luminescent organ called the esca at the tip of a modified dorsal ray (the illicium or fishing rod; derived from [Latin] Latin  ēsca ēsca , ""bait""). The organ has been hypothesized to serve the purpose of luring prey in dark, deep-sea environments, but also serves to call males' attention to the females to facilitate mating.
The source of luminescence is [symbiotic] symbiotic bacteria that dwell in and around the esca, enclosed in a cup-shaped reflector containing crystals, probably consisting of [guanine] guanine . Anglerfish make use of these symbiotic relationships with extracellular luminous bacteria. Atypical of luminous symbionts that live outside of the host's cells, the bacteria found in the lures of anglerfish are experiencing an evolutionary shift to smaller and less developed genomes (genomic reduction) assisted by [transposon] transposon expansions. Only a handful of luminescent symbiont species can associate with deep-sea anglerfishes. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. While females found within most anglerfish families have bioluminescence, there are exceptions including the [Caulophrynidae] Caulophrynidae and [Neoceratiidae] Neoceratiidae families. 
The bacterial symbionts are not found at consistent levels throughout stages of anglerfish development or throughout the different depths of the ocean. Sequencing of larval organisms of the [Ceratioidei] Ceratioidei suborder show an absence of bacterial symbionts, while sequencing of adult anglerfish showed higher levels of [bioluminescent] bioluminescent bacterial symbionts. This correlates to the [mesopelagic] mesopelagic region having the highest levels of symbiont relationships in the anglerfish samples, as this is where adult anglerfish reside for most of their lives after their larval stage. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are [Gram-negative] Gram-negative rods that lack [capsules] capsules , [spores] spores , or [flagella] flagella . They have double-layered cell walls and [mesosomes] mesosomes . A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the [pH] pH and [tonicity] tonicity of the [culture medium] culture medium to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the [bathypelagic zone] bathypelagic zone inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of bacterial cultures. 
The light gland is always open to the exterior, so it is possible that the fish acquires the bacteria from the seawater. However, it appears that each species uses its own particular species of bacteria, and these bacteria have never been found in seawater. Haygood (1993) theorized that esca discharge bacteria during spawning and the bacteria are thereby transferred to the eggs. 
Some evidence shows that some anglerfish acquired their bioluminescent symbionts from the local environment. Genetic materials of the symbiont bacteria is found near the anglerfish, indicating that the anglerfish and their associated bacteria are most likely not evolved together and the bacteria take difficult journeys to enter the host. In a study on Ceratioid anglerfish in the Gulf of Mexico, researchers noticed that the confirmed host-associated bioluminescent microbes are not present in the larval specimens and throughout host development. The Ceratioids likely acquired their bioluminescent symbionts from the seawater.  Photobacterium phosphoreum [Photobacterium phosphoreum] Photobacterium phosphoreum and members from kishitanii clade constitute the major or sole bioluminescent symbiont of several families of deep-sea luminous fishes. 
It is known that genetic makeup of the symbiont bacteria has undergone changes since they became associated with their host. Compared to their free-living relatives, deep-sea anglerfish symbiont genomes are reduced in size by 50%. Reductions in amino acid synthesis pathways and abilities to utilize diverse sugars are found. Nevertheless, genes involved in [chemotaxis] chemotaxis and motility that are thought to be useful only outside the host are retained in the genome. Symbiont genome contains very high numbers of [pseudogenes] pseudogenes and show massive expansions of [transposable elements] transposable elements . The process of genome reduction is still ongoing in these symbionts lineages, and the gene loss may lead to host dependence. 
In most species, a wide mouth extends all around the anterior circumference of the head, and bands of inwardly inclined teeth line both jaws. The teeth can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the mouth. The anglerfish is able to distend both its jaw and its stomach, since its bones are thin and flexible, to enormous size, allowing it to swallow prey up to twice as large as its entire body. 
== Behavior ==
=== Swimming and energy conservation ===
In 2005, near [Monterey, California] Monterey, California , at 1,474 metres depth, an [ROV] ROV filmed a female ceratioid anglerfish of the genus Oneirodes Oneirodes for 24 minutes. When approached, the fish retreated rapidly, but in 74% of the video footage, it drifted passively, oriented at any angle. When advancing, it swam intermittently at a speed of 0.24 body lengths per second, beating its pectoral fins in-phase. The lethargic behavior of this [ambush predator] ambush predator is suited to the energy-poor environment of the deep sea. 
Another in situ observation of three different whipnose anglerfish showed unusual inverted swimming-behavior. Fish were observed floating inverted completely motionless with the illicium hanging down stiffly in a slight arch in front of the fish. The illicium was hanging over small visible burrows. It was suggested this is an effort to entice prey and an example of low-energy opportunistic foraging and predation. When the ROV approached the fish, they exhibited burst swimming, still inverted. 
The jaw and stomach of the anglerfish can extend to allow it to consume prey up to twice its size. Because of the limited amount of food available in the anglerfish's environment, this adaptation allows the anglerfish to store food when there is an abundance. 
=== Predation ===
The name ""anglerfish"" derives from the species' characteristic method of predation. Anglerfish typically have at least one long filament sprouting from the middle of their heads, termed the illicium. The illicium is the detached and modified first three spines of the [anterior] anterior  [dorsal fin] dorsal fin . In most anglerfish species, the longest filament is the first. This first spine protrudes above the fish's eyes and terminates in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca), and can move in all directions. Anglerfish can wiggle the esca to make it [resemble] resemble a prey animal, which lures the anglerfish's prey close enough for the anglerfish to devour them whole. Some deep-sea anglerfish of the [bathypelagic zone] bathypelagic zone also emit light from their [esca] esca to attract prey. 
Because anglerfish are opportunistic foragers, they show a range of preferred prey with fish at the extremes of the size spectrum, whilst showing increased selectivity for certain prey. One study examining the stomach contents of threadfin anglerfish off the Pacific coast of Central America found these fish primarily ate two categories of [benthic] benthic prey: [crustaceans] crustaceans and [teleost] teleost fish. The most frequent prey were [pandalid shrimp] pandalid shrimp . 52% of the stomachs examined were empty, supporting the observations that anglerfish are low energy consumers. 
=== Reproduction ===
Some anglerfish, like those of the Ceratiidae, or sea devils, employ an unusual mating method. Because individuals are locally rare, encounters are also very rare. Therefore, finding a mate is problematic. When scientists first started capturing ceratioid anglerfish, they noticed that all of the specimens were female. These individuals were a few centimetres in size and almost all of them had what appeared to be [parasites] parasites attached to them. It turned out that these ""parasites"" were highly dimorphic male ceratioids. This indicates some taxa of anglerfish use a [polyandrous] polyandrous mating system. In some species of anglerfish, fusion between male and female when reproducing is possible due to the lack of immune system keys that allow antibodies to mature and create receptors for T-cells. It is assumed they have evolved new immune strategies which compensate for the loss of B and T lymphocyte functions found in an [adaptive immune system] adaptive immune system . 
Certain ceratioids rely on [parabiotic] parabiotic reproduction. Free-living males and unparasitized females in these species never have fully developed gonads. Thus, males never mature without attaching to a female, and die if they cannot find one. At birth, male ceratioids are already equipped with extremely well-developed [olfactory organs] olfactory organs that detect scents in the water. Males of some species also develop large, highly specialized eyes that may aid in identifying mates in dark environments. The male ceratioids are significantly smaller than a female anglerfish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, growth of the [alimentary canals] alimentary canals of some males becomes stunted, preventing them from feeding. Some taxa have jaws that are never suitable or effective for prey capture. These features mean the male must quickly find a female anglerfish to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male to detect the [pheromones] pheromones that signal the proximity of a female anglerfish.
The methods anglerfish use to locate mates vary. Some species have minute eyes that are unfit for identifying females, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making them unlikely to effectively find females by scent. When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an [enzyme] enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism ensures that when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a ""one male per female"" rule. 
Symbiosis is not the only method of reproduction in anglerfish. In fact, many families, including the [Melanocetidae] Melanocetidae , [Himantolophidae] Himantolophidae , [Diceratiidae] Diceratiidae , and [Gigantactinidae] Gigantactinidae , show no evidence of male symbiosis. Females in some of these species contain large, developed ovaries and free-living males have large testes, suggesting these sexually mature individuals may spawn during a temporary sexual attachment that does not involve fusion of tissue. Males in these species also have well-toothed jaws that are far more effective in hunting than those seen in symbiotic species. 
Sexual symbiosis may be an optional strategy in some species of anglerfishes. In the [Oneirodidae] Oneirodidae , females carrying symbiotic males have been reported in Leptacanthichthys Leptacanthichthys and Bertella Bertella —and others that were not still developed fully functional gonads. One theory suggests the males attach to females regardless of their own reproductive development if the female is not sexually mature, but when both male and female are mature, they spawn then separate. 
One explanation for the [evolution] evolution of sexual symbiosis is that the relatively low density of females in deep-sea environments leaves little opportunity for [mate choice] mate choice among anglerfish. Females remain large to accommodate [fecundity] fecundity , as is evidenced by their large ovaries and eggs. Males would be expected to shrink to reduce metabolic costs in resource-poor environments and would develop highly specialized female-finding abilities. If a male manages to find a female, then symbiotic attachment is ultimately more likely to improve life-time fitness relative to free living, particularly when the prospect of finding future mates is poor. An additional advantage to symbiosis is that the male's sperm can be used in multiple fertilizations, as he always remains available to the female for mating. Higher densities of male-female encounters might correlate with species that demonstrate [facultative symbiosis] facultative symbiosis or simply use a more traditional temporary contact mating. 
The spawn of the anglerfish of the genus Lophius [Lophius] Lophius consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material 25 cm (10 in) wide and greater than 10 m (33 ft) long. Such an egg sheet is rare among fish. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own cavity. The spawn is free in the sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins elongated into filaments. 
== Threats ==
Northwest European Lophius [Lophius] Lophius species are heavily fished and are listed by the [ICES] ICES as ""outside safe biological limits"". Additionally, anglerfish are known to occasionally rise to the surface during [El Niño] El Niño , leaving large groups of dead anglerfish floating on the surface. 
In 2010, [Greenpeace] Greenpeace International added the American angler ( Lophius americanus [Lophius americanus] Lophius americanus ), the angler ( Lophius piscatorius [Lophius piscatorius] Lophius piscatorius ), and the black-bellied angler ( Lophius budegassa [Lophius budegassa] Lophius budegassa ) to its seafood red list—a list of fish commonly sold worldwide with a high likelihood of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.

== Human consumption ==
One family, the [Lophiidae] Lophiidae , is of commercial interest with fisheries found in western Europe, eastern North America, Africa, and East Asia. In Europe and North America, the tail meat of fish of the genus Lophius Lophius , known as monkfish or goosefish (North America), is widely used in cooking, and is often compared to [lobster] lobster tail in taste and texture.
In Africa, the countries of Namibia and the Republic of South Africa record the highest catches. In Asia, especially Japan, monkfish liver, known as ankimo [ankimo] ankimo , is considered a delicacy. Anglerfish is especially heavily consumed in South Korea, where it is featured as the main ingredient in dishes such as Agujjim [Agujjim] Agujjim .

Leafy Seadragon,Leafy seadragon,"
The leafy seadragon leafy seadragon ( Phycodurus eques Phycodurus eques ) or Glauert's seadragon Glauert's seadragon , is a marine [fish] fish . It is the [only member] only member of the genus Phycodurus Phycodurus Phycodurus in the family [Syngnathidae] Syngnathidae , which includes [seadragons] seadragons , [pipefish] pipefish , and [seahorses] seahorses . 
It is found along the southern and western coasts of [Australia] Australia . The name is derived from their appearance, with long leaf-like protrusions coming from all over the body. These protrusions are not used for propulsion; they serve only as [camouflage] camouflage . The leafy seadragon propels itself utilising a pair of [pectoral fins] pectoral fins on the sides of its neck and a [dorsal fin] dorsal fin on its back closer to the tail end. These small fins are almost completely transparent and difficult to see as they [undulate] undulate minutely to move the creature sedately through the water, completing the illusion of floating [seaweed] seaweed .
Popularly known as ""leafies"", they are the [marine emblem] marine emblem of the state of [South Australia] South Australia and a focus for local marine conservation. 
== Taxonomy ==
The generic name is derived from the Greek words φῦκος φῦκος φῦκος  phûkos phûkos ""seaweed"" and δέρμα δέρμα δέρμα  derma derma ""skin"". 
== Description ==
Much like the [seahorse] seahorse , the leafy seadragon's name is derived from its resemblance to another creature (in this case, the mythical [dragon] dragon ). While not large, they are slightly larger than most seahorses, growing to about 20–24 cm (8–9.5 in). They feed on [plankton] plankton and small [crustaceans] crustaceans .
The lobes of skin that grow on the leafy seadragon provide [camouflage] camouflage , giving it the appearance of seaweed. It is able to maintain the illusion when swimming, appearing to move through the water like a piece of floating seaweed. It can also change colour to blend in, but this ability depends on the seadragon's diet, age, location, and stress level.
The leafy seadragon is related to the [pipefish] pipefish and belongs to the family [Syngnathidae] Syngnathidae , along with the seahorse. It differs from the seahorse in appearance, form of locomotion, and its inability to coil or grasp things with its tail. A related species is the [weedy seadragon] weedy seadragon , which is multicoloured and grows weed-like fins, but is smaller than the leafy seadragon. Another unique feature is the small, circular gill openings covering tufted gills, very unlike the crescent-shaped gill openings and ridged gills of most fish species. 
== Habitat and distribution ==
The leafy seadragon is found only in southern Australian waters, from [Wilson’s Promontory] Wilson’s Promontory in [Victoria] Victoria at the eastern end of its range, westward to [Jurien Bay] Jurien Bay ,  220 km (140 mi) north of [Perth] Perth in [Western Australia] Western Australia . Individuals were once thought to have very restricted ranges; but further research has discovered that seadragons actually travel several hundred metres from their habitual locations, returning to the same spot using a strong sense of direction. They are mostly found over sand patches in waters up to 50 m (160 ft) deep, around kelp-covered rocks and clumps of sea grass. They are commonly sighted by scuba divers near [Adelaide] Adelaide in South Australia, especially at [Rapid Bay] Rapid Bay , [Edithburgh] Edithburgh , and [Victor Harbor] Victor Harbor . 
== Ecology ==
Leafy seadragons usually live a solitary lifestyle. When the time comes, males court the females, they then pair up to breed. From the moment they hatch, leafy seadragons are completely independent. By the age of two, they are typically full grown and ready to breed. 
The species feeds by sucking up small crustaceans, such as [amphipods] amphipods and [mysid shrimp] mysid shrimp , [plankton] plankton , and [larval fish] larval fish through its long, pipe-like snout. 
=== Reproduction ===
As with seahorses, the male leafy seadragon cares for the [eggs] eggs . The female produces up to 250 bright pink eggs, then deposits them onto the male's tail with her [ovipositor] ovipositor , a long tube. The eggs then attach themselves to a brood patch, which supplies them with oxygen. After 9 weeks, the eggs begin to hatch, depending on water conditions. The eggs turn a ripe purple or orange over this period, after which the male pumps his tail until the young emerge, a process which takes place over 24–48 hours. The male aids the hatching of the eggs by shaking his tail, and rubbing it against seaweed and rocks. Once born, the young seadragon is completely independent, eating small [zooplankton] zooplankton until large enough to hunt [mysids] mysids . Only about 5% of the eggs survive. Each newborn fry begins life with a small, externally-attached yolk-sac. This sac provides them sustenance for their first few days of life. Despite this initial nutrition source, the majority of fry will instinctively learn to hunt and catch prey upon hatching, and will become self-reliant before the sac is gone. 
=== Movement ===
The leafy seadragon uses the fins along the side of its head to allow it to steer and turn. However, its outer skin is fairly rigid, limiting mobility. Individual leafy seadragons have been observed remaining in one location for extended periods of time (up to 68 hours), but will sometimes move for lengthy periods. The tracking of one individual indicated it moved at up to 150 m (490 ft) per hour. 
== Conservation ==
Leafy seadragons are subject to many threats, both natural and man-made. They are caught by collectors, and used in [alternative medicine] alternative medicine . They are vulnerable when first born, and are slow swimmers, reducing their chance of escaping from a predator. Seadragons are sometimes washed ashore after storms. 
The species has become endangered through [pollution] pollution and industrial runoff, as well as collection for the aquarium trade. In response to these dangers, the species has been totally protected in [South Australia] South Australia since 1987, [Victoria] Victoria since at least 1995, and [Western Australia] Western Australia since 1991. Additionally, the species' listing in the [Australian government] Australian government 's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999] Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 means that the welfare of the species has to be considered as a part of any developmental project. 
== In captivity ==
Due to being protected by law, obtaining seadragons is often an expensive and difficult process as they must be from [captive bred] captive bred stock, and exporters must prove their [broodstock] broodstock were caught before collecting restrictions went into effect, or that they had a license to collect seadragons. Seadragons have a specific level of protection under federal [fisheries] fisheries legislation as well as in most Australian states where they occur. Seadragons are difficult to maintain in aquaria. Success in keeping them has been largely confined to the public aquarium sector, due to funding and knowledge that would not be available to the average enthusiast. Attempts to breed the leafy seadragon in [captivity] captivity have so far been unsuccessful. 
=== Australia ===
Australian aquaria featuring leafy seadragons include the [Sydney Aquarium] Sydney Aquarium , the [Melbourne Aquarium] Melbourne Aquarium , and the [Aquarium of Western Australia] Aquarium of Western Australia . 
=== Canada ===
[Ripley's Aquarium of Canada] Ripley's Aquarium of Canada in [Toronto] Toronto displays both leafy and weedy seadragons. 
=== South East Asia ===
[S.E.A. Aquarium] S.E.A. Aquarium , located in the [Marine Life Park] Marine Life Park of [Singapore] Singapore , displays both leafy and weedy seadragons.
=== United States ===
A number of aquaria in the United States have leafy seadragon research programs and/or displays. Among these are the [Adventure Aquarium] Adventure Aquarium in Camden, New Jersey;  [Aquarium of the Pacific] Aquarium of the Pacific at Long Beach;  [Birch Aquarium] Birch Aquarium in San Diego; the [Minnesota Zoo] Minnesota Zoo ;  [Monterey Bay Aquarium] Monterey Bay Aquarium ; the [Dallas World Aquarium] Dallas World Aquarium & the [Dallas Children's Aquarium] Dallas Children's Aquarium , Dallas; the [New England Aquarium] New England Aquarium , Boston; the [Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium] Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington; the [Newport Aquarium] Newport Aquarium in Kentucky, the [Shedd Aquarium] Shedd Aquarium , Chicago; the [California Academy of Sciences] California Academy of Sciences ; the [Tennessee Aquarium] Tennessee Aquarium ;  [Sea World Orlando] Sea World Orlando , Florida; the [Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium] Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium ;, Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies, Gatlinburg, Tennessee; , The Florida Aquarium in Tampa, Florida; the Mote Aquarium in Sarasota, Florida; , and Ripley's Aquarium Broadway at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. 
=== Europe ===
The Lisbon Aquarium (Lisboa Oceanarium) has both leafy sea dragons and weedy sea dragons. 
== Cultural references ==
The leafy seadragon is the official marine emblem of the state of South Australia. It also features in the logos of the following South Australian associations — the [Adelaide University] Adelaide University Scuba Club Inc. and the [Marine Life Society of South Australia Inc.] Marine Life Society of South Australia Inc. 
A biennial [Leafy Sea Dragon Festival] Leafy Sea Dragon Festival is held within the boundaries of the [District Council of Yankalilla] District Council of Yankalilla in South Australia. It is a festival of the environment, arts and culture of the [Fleurieu Peninsula] Fleurieu Peninsula , with the theme of celebrating the leafy seadragon. The inaugural festival in 2005 attracted over 7,000 participants including 4000 visitors. 
In 2006, an animated short film, The Amazing Adventures of Gavin, a Leafy Seadragon The Amazing Adventures of Gavin, a Leafy Seadragon , was made on behalf of several South Australian organisations involved in conserving the marine environment, including the Coast Protection Board, the [Department of Environment and Heritage] Department of Environment and Heritage and the Marine Discovery Centre. Made through a collaboration of [The People's Republic of Animation] The People's Republic of Animation , Waterline Productions and the [SA Film Corporation] SA Film Corporation , the film is an introductory guide to marine conservation and the marine [bioregions] bioregions of South Australia suitable for 8–12 year olds, and copies were distributed on DVD to all primary schools in the State. An educator's resource kit to accompany the film was released in 2008.

Gharial,Gharial,"
The gharial gharial ( Gavialis gangeticus Gavialis gangeticus Gavialis gangeticus ), also known as gavial gavial or fish-eating crocodile fish-eating crocodile , is a [crocodilian] crocodilian in the [family] family  [Gavialidae] Gavialidae and among the longest of all living crocodilians. Mature females are 2.6 to 4.5 m (8 ft 6 in to 14 ft 9 in) long, and males 3 to 6 m (9 ft 10 in to 19 ft 8 in). Adult males have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ghara [ghara] ghara , hence the name ""gharial"". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, narrow snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.
The gharial probably evolved in the northern [Indian subcontinent] Indian subcontinent . Fossil gharial remains were excavated in [Pliocene] Pliocene deposits in the [Sivalik Hills] Sivalik Hills and the [Narmada River] Narmada River valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests, in which they lay 20–95 eggs. They guard the nests and the young, which hatch before the onset of the [monsoon] monsoon . The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow.
The wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s. [Loss of habitat] Loss of habitat because of [sand mining] sand mining and conversion to agriculture, depletion of fish resources and detrimental fishing methods continue to threaten the population. It has been listed as [critically endangered] critically endangered on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List since 2007.
The oldest known depictions of the gharial are about 4,000 years old and were found in the [Indus Valley] Indus Valley . [Hindus] Hindus regard it as the vehicle of the river deity [Gaṅgā] Gaṅgā . Local people living near rivers attributed mystical and healing powers to the gharial, and used some of its body parts as ingredients of [indigenous medicine] indigenous medicine .
== Etymology ==
The name 'gharial' is derived from the [Hindustani] Hindustani word ' [ghara] ghara ' for an earthen pot, in reference to the nasal [protuberance] protuberance on the adult male's snout. It is also called 'gavial'. The name 'fish-eating crocodile' is a translation of its [Bengali] Bengali name 'mecho kumhir', with 'mecho' being derived from 'māch' meaning fish and 'kumhir' meaning crocodile. The name 'Indian gharial' has occasionally been used for gharial populations in India. 
== Taxonomy ==
Lacerta gangetica Lacerta gangetica was the [scientific name] scientific name proposed by [Johann Friedrich Gmelin] Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. Gmelin followed [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus who proposed Lacerta Lacerta in 1758 to include other [crocodiles] crocodiles and various [lizards] lizards known at the time. 
The gharial was placed in the [genus] genus  Crocodilus [Crocodilus] Crocodilus by subsequent naturalists:
The [generic] generic name Gavialis [Gavialis] Gavialis was proposed by [Nicolaus Michael Oppel] Nicolaus Michael Oppel in 1811 for crocodiles with a cylindrical-shaped back. He placed this genus in the family Crocodilini.  Rhamphostoma Rhamphostoma was proposed by [Johann Georg Wagler] Johann Georg Wagler in 1830 who considered this genus to contain two species, Crocodilus gangeticus Crocodilus gangeticus and C. tenuirostris C. tenuirostris . 
The family name [Gavialidae] Gavialidae was proposed by [Arthur Adams] Arthur Adams in 1854 with Gavialis Gavialis as the only genus in this family.  Gavialis gangetica Gavialis gangetica was the scientific name used by [Albert Günther] Albert Günther in 1864 who considered L. gangetica L. gangetica , C. longirostris C. longirostris and C. tenuirostris C. tenuirostris as [synonyms] synonyms and Gavialis Gavialis a [monotypic taxon] monotypic taxon .  [John Edward Gray] John Edward Gray reviewed [zoological specimens] zoological specimens in the collection of the [Natural History Museum, London] Natural History Museum, London . He also considered the gharial monotypic in 1869. He placed it in the family Gavialidae together with the [false gharial] false gharial ( Tomistoma schlegelii Tomistoma schlegelii ) because both have long, slender jaws and similar dentition. 
Gharialis hysudricus Gharialis hysudricus proposed by [Richard Lydekker] Richard Lydekker in 1886 was based on a fossil skull from the [Sivalik Hills] Sivalik Hills that was larger than gharial fossil skulls known at the time. This name is considered to be a [junior synonym] junior synonym of Gavialis gangeticus Gavialis gangeticus . 
== Evolution ==
The evolution of the gharial and its relationship with and divergence from other crocodilians have been a subject of controversy. Some authors assumed that the gharial evolved earlier than the other crocodilians because of its distinct skull shape and dentition, indicating a more advanced level of specialization. Others suggested that it evolved much later than other crocodilians because of its low levels of [blood protein] blood protein divergence. As it shares this trait with the false gharial, it was suggested that they form a [sister group] sister group . In contrast, it was suggested that the gharial and all the other crocodilians form a sister group as the structure of its tail muscles is unique.  [Sequencing] Sequencing of a [ribosomal] ribosomal segment of [mitochondrial DNAs] mitochondrial DNAs of gharial and false gharial revealed that they share 22 unique [nucleotides] nucleotides , a similarity of 94%, supporting the view that they are sister taxa. Analyses of [nuclear gene] nuclear gene sequences of both species also support the view that they are sister taxa.  [Molecular genetics] Molecular genetics and [tip dating] tip dating studies indicates a [genetic divergence] genetic divergence between the gharial and false gharial in the [Eocene] Eocene about [38] 38 million years ago . 
The genus Gavialis [Gavialis] Gavialis probably originated in the region of India and Pakistan in the [Early Miocene] Early Miocene . Fossil gharial remains excavated in the [Sivalik Hills] Sivalik Hills of [Haryana] Haryana and [Himachal Pradesh] Himachal Pradesh are dated to between the [Pliocene] Pliocene and the [Early Pleistocene] Early Pleistocene . Fossil gharial remains were also found at two sites in the [Ayeyarwady River] Ayeyarwady River valley in central Myanmar, which are dated to the [Late Pleistocene] Late Pleistocene . During the [Quaternary] Quaternary , Gavialis Gavialis dispersed as far as [Java] Java via the Siva– [Malayan] Malayan route, which did not require saltwater crossings. Fossil remains of Gavialis bengawanicus [Gavialis bengawanicus] Gavialis bengawanicus found on Java were dated to the Early Pleistocene.  G. bengawanicus G. bengawanicus fossils found in Thailand's [Nakhon Ratchasima Province] Nakhon Ratchasima Province support the hypothesis of gharial dispersal through riverine systems. It represents the only valid extinct Gavialis Gavialis species.

== Characteristics ==
The gharial is olive-coloured, with adults being darker than young, which have dark brown cross bands and speckles. Its back turns almost black at 20 years of age, but its belly is yellowish-white. It has four transverse rows of two [scales] scales on the neck, which continue along the back.  [Scutes] Scutes on the head, neck and back form a single continuous plate composed of 21 to 22 transverse series, and four longitudinal series. Scutes on the back are bony, but softer and feebly keeled on the sides. The outer edges of the forearms, legs, and feet have crests jutting out; fingers and toes are partly webbed. 
Its snout is very long and narrow, widened at the end, and with 27 to 29 upper teeth and 25 or 26 lower teeth on each side. The front teeth are the largest. The first, second, and third lower jaw teeth fit into spaces in the upper jaw. The extremely long [mandibular symphysis] mandibular symphysis extends to the 23rd or 24th tooth. The snout of adult gharials is 3.5 times longer than the width of the skull's base. Because of this long snout the gharial is especially adapted to catching and eating fish. The [nasal bones] nasal bones are rather short and widely spaced from the [premaxillae] premaxillae . The [jugal bone] jugal bone is raised. It becomes proportionally thicker with age. Two individuals in the weight range of 103–121 kg (227–267 lb) had an average measured [bite force] bite force of 1,784–2,006 [N] N (401–451 [lbf] lb f f ). 
Male gharials develop a hollow bulbous nasal protuberance at the tip of the snout upon reaching [sexual maturity] sexual maturity . This protuberance resembles an earthen pot known locally as ""ghara"". The male's ghara starts growing over the [nostrils] nostrils at an age of 11.5 years and measures about 5 cm × 6 cm × 3.5 cm (2.0 in × 2.4 in × 1.4 in) at an age of 15.5 years. It enables the males to emit a hissing sound that can be heard 75 m (246 ft) away. The gharial is the only living crocodilian with such visible [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism . Mature male gharials have larger [skulls] skulls than females, exceeding a basal length of 715 mm (28.1 in) and a width of 287 mm (11.3 in). 
Female gharials reach sexual maturity at a body length of 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in) and grow up to 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in). Males mature at a body length of at least 3 m (9 ft 10 in) and grow up to a length of 6 m (19 ft 8 in). Adult males weigh about 160 kg (350 lb) on average, but can reach a weight of up to 600 kg (1,300 lb). The gharial is among the largest living crocodilians, with the heaviest recorded male weighing 977 kg (2,154 lb). A 6.55 m (21 ft 6 in) long gharial was claimed to have been killed in the [Ghaghara River] Ghaghara River in [Faizabad] Faizabad in August 1920, though no reliable measurements were taken. Male gharials with an alleged length of 7.16 to 9.14 m (23 ft 6 in – 30 ft 0 in) were sighted around the turn of the 20th century in Indian rivers. Overall, the gharial is less massive when compared to other crocodilians of similar length; a 4.9 m (16 ft) long gharial weighed around 560 kg (1,230 lb), while a 4.8 m (16 ft) long [Nile crocodile] Nile crocodile weighed 680 kg (1,500 lb). 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The gharial once thrived in all the major river systems of the northern Indian subcontinent, from the [Indus River] Indus River in [Pakistan] Pakistan , the [Ganges] Ganges in India, the [Brahmaputra River] Brahmaputra River in [northeastern India] northeastern India and [Bangladesh] Bangladesh to the [Irrawaddy River] Irrawaddy River in [Myanmar] Myanmar . In the early 20th century, it was considered common in the Indus River and its [Punjabi] Punjabi tributaries. By the early 1980s, it was almost extinct in the Indus. During surveys in 2008 and 2009, no gharial was sighted in the river. It was also present in India's [Godavari River] Godavari River but was hunted to extinction between the late 1940s and the 1960s. It was considered extinct in the [Koshi River] Koshi River since 1970. In the 1940s, it was numerous in the [Barak River] Barak River in [Assam] Assam , which held big fish at the time including [golden mahseer] golden mahseer ( Tor putitora Tor putitora ). A few individuals were also sighted in tributaries of the Barak River in Assam, [Mizoram] Mizoram and [Manipur] Manipur up to 1988, but surveys were not carried out. In 1927, a gharial was shot in the [Shweli River] Shweli River in Myanmar, a tributary of the Ayeyawady River. This is the only authenticated record in the country attesting the survival of gharials into the 20th century. Whether gharials still live in the Shweli River today is possible but remained unclear in 2012. 
By 1976, its global range had decreased to only 2% of its historical range, and fewer than 200 gharials were estimated to survive. It is [locally extinct] locally extinct in Pakistan, [Bhutan] Bhutan and Myanmar. Since the early 1980s, the population has been reinforced with captive-bred gharials that were released into wild habitats in India and Nepal. In 2017, the global population was estimated to comprise at maximum 900 individuals, including about 600 mature adults in six major subpopulations along 1,100 km (680 mi) of river courses and another 50 mature adults in eight minor subpopulations along 1,200 km (750 mi) of river courses. 
In Nepal, small populations are present and slowly recovering in tributaries of the Ganges, such as the [Karnali] Karnali – [Babai River] Babai River system in [Bardia National Park] Bardia National Park and the [Narayani] Narayani –Rapti river system in [Chitwan National Park] Chitwan National Park . In spring 2017, the Babai River was surveyed using an [unmanned aerial vehicle] unmanned aerial vehicle , which detected 33 gharials on a stretch of 102 km (63 mi). 
In India, gharial populations are present in the:
Between 1979 and 1993, less than 20 individuals were sighted in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River between [Kaziranga National Park] Kaziranga National Park and [Dibru-Saikhowa National Park] Dibru-Saikhowa National Park . This population had declined due to commercial fishing, [poaching] poaching , encroachment by local people in gharial breeding grounds and [siltation] siltation of river beds following [deforestation] deforestation . In 1998, it was not considered to be viable. About 30 gharials were observed in small lakes and tributaries of the Brahmaputra River in Assam between 2004 and 2007. 
In Bangladesh, gharials were recorded in [Padma] Padma , [Jamuna] Jamuna , [Mahananda] Mahananda and Brahmaputra rivers between 2000 and 2015. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The gharial is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian. It leaves the water only for [basking] basking on riverbanks. Being cold-blooded, it seeks to cool down during hot times and to warm up when ambient temperature is cool. Gharials bask daily in the cold season, foremost in the mornings, and prefer sandy and moist beaches. They change their basking pattern with increasing daily temperatures; they start basking earlier in the mornings, move back into the river when it is hot, and return to the beach later in the afternoon. Groups comprising an adult male, several females and subadults have been observed to bask together. Adult males dominate groups and tolerate immature males. Large groups of young, subadult and adult gharials form in December and January to bask. Adult males and females associate by mid February. 
The gharial shares riverine habitat with the [mugger crocodile] mugger crocodile ( Crocodylus palustris Crocodylus palustris ) in parts of its range. They use the same nesting grounds, but differ in the selection of basking sites. The gharial basks close to water on shallow, sandy beaches and lays eggs only in sandy soil near water. The mugger crocodile also basks on sandy beaches, but unlike the gharial climbs steep embankments and rocks, and moves farther away from beaches for both basking and nest building. It also preys on fish, but has a broader prey base than the gharial including [snakes] snakes , [turtles] turtles , [birds] birds , [mammals] mammals and dead animals. 
=== Feeding ecology ===
The gharial is well adapted to hunting fish underwater because of its sharp interlocking teeth and long narrow snout, which meets little resistance in the water. It does not chew its prey, but swallows it whole. Juvenile gharials were observed to jerk their heads back to manoeuvre fish into their gullets, sliding them in head first. Young gharials feed on [insects] insects , [tadpoles] tadpoles , small fish and [frogs] frogs . Adults also feed on small [crustaceans] crustaceans . Remains of [Indian softshell turtle] Indian softshell turtle ( Nilssonia gangetica Nilssonia gangetica ) were also found in gharial stomachs. Gharials tear apart large fish and pick up and swallow stones as [gastroliths] gastroliths , probably to aid digestion or regulate buoyancy. Some gharial stomachs also contained jewellery. Stones weighing about 4.5 kg (10 lb) were found in a gharial's stomach that was shot in the [Sharda River] Sharda River in 1910. 
=== Reproduction ===
Females mature at a body length of around 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in). Captive females breed at a body length of 3 m (9 ft 10 in). Male gharials mature at 15–18 years of age, when they reach a body length of around 4 m (13 ft) and once the ghara is developed. The ghara is apparently used to indicate sexual maturity, as a sound resonator when bubbling underwater or for other sexual behaviours. 
Courting and [mating] mating starts by mid-February at the end of the cold season. In the dry season, reproductive females observed in the Chambal River routinely move 80–120 km (50–75 mi) and join female breeding groups to dig nests together. They select sites in riverside sand or silt banks located between  2.5 and 14.5 m (8 ft 2 in and 47 ft 7 in) away from the water and above a water level of 1 to 3.5 m (3 ft 3 in to 11 ft 6 in). These nests are 20–55 cm (8 in – 1 ft 10 in) deep with a diameter of about 50–60 cm (1 ft 8 in – 2 ft 0 in). Between end of March and early April, they lay 20–95 [eggs] eggs . A record [clutch] clutch with 97 eggs was found in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. The eggs are the largest of all crocodilians and weigh an average of 160 g (5.6 oz). Each egg is 85–90 mm (3.3–3.5 in) long and 65–70 mm (2.6–2.8 in) wide. After 71 to 93 days of [incubation] incubation , young gharials hatch in July just before the onset of the [monsoon] monsoon . Their sex is most likely [determined by temperature] determined by temperature , like in most reptiles. Females dig up the [hatchlings] hatchlings in response to hatching chirps, but do not assist them to reach the water. They stay at nesting sites until monsoon floods arrive and return after monsoon. 
Captive male gharials observed in the 1980s did not participate in guarding nests. A captive male gharial was observed to show an interest in hatchlings and was allowed by the female to carry hatchlings on his back. In the Chambal River, females were observed to stay close to nest sites and guard young gharials until the shoreline was flooded. [VHF] VHF  [radio tracking] radio tracking of a junior male gharial revealed that he was the dominant male guarding nests at a communal nesting site for two years. 
=== Development ===
Hatchlings range from 34–39.2 cm (13.4–15.4 in) in body length with a weight of 82–130 g (2.9–4.6 oz). In two years, they grow to a length of 80–116 cm (31–46 in) and of 130–158 cm (51–62 in) in three years. Gharials hatched and raised in Nepal's Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center measured 140–167 cm (55–66 in) and weighed 5.6–10.5 kg (12–23 lb) at the age of 45 months in April 2013. They consumed up to 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) of fish per individual and month. By the age of 75 months, they had gained 5.9–19.5 kg (13–43 lb) in weight and grown 29–62 cm (11–24 in) reaching body lengths of 169–229 cm (67–90 in). 
Young gharials in their first year of age hide and forage in shallow water preferably in sites that are surrounded by debris of fallen trees. A study along a 425 km (264 mi) stretch of the Chambal River revealed that juvenile gharials up to a body length of 120 cm (3 ft 11 in) prefer basking sites where the mid river water is 1–3 m (3 ft 3 in – 9 ft 10 in) deep. As their body size increases, they move to sites with deeper water. Subadult and adult gharials above a body length of 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) prefer sites where the water is deeper than 4 m (13 ft 1 in). 
Young gharials move forward by pushing the diagonally opposite legs synchronously. At a young age, they can also gallop but do so only in emergency situations. When they reach a length of about 75 cm (30 in) and a weight of about 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) at the age of 8–9 months, they change to an adult pattern of locomotion of pushing forward with hind and front legs simultaneously. Adults do not have the ability to walk on land in the semi-upright stance as other crocodilians. When basking on the beach, they often turn round so as to face the water. 
== Threats ==
The gharial population is estimated to have declined from 5,000–10,000 individuals in 1946 to fewer than 250 individuals in 2006, a decline of 96–98% within three generations. Gharials were killed by fishermen, hunted for skins, trophies and [indigenous medicine] indigenous medicine , and their eggs collected for consumption. The remaining individuals form several fragmented subpopulations. Hunting is no longer considered a significant threat. However, the wild population declined from an estimated 436 adult gharials in 1997 to fewer than 250 mature individuals in 2006. One reason for this decline is the increased use of [gill nets] gill nets for fishing in gharial habitat. The other major reason is the loss of riverine habitat as dams, [barrages] barrages , irrigation canals and artificial [embankments] embankments were built; [siltation] siltation and [sand-mining] sand-mining changed river courses; and land near rivers is used for agriculture and grazing by livestock. 
When 111 dead gharials were found in the Chambal River between December 2007 and March 2008, it was initially suspected that they had died either because of toxicants or the illegal use of fish nets, in which they became entrapped in and subsequently drowned. Later post mortem [pathological] pathological testing of tissue samples revealed high levels of [heavy metals] heavy metals such as [lead] lead and [cadmium] cadmium , which together with stomach [ulcers] ulcers and [protozoan] protozoan  [parasites] parasites reported in most [necropsies] necropsies were thought to have caused their deaths. Water pumps used for pumping water out of the Chambal River have proven to negatively impact the gharial population. 
Threats in unprotected stretches of the Karnali River include [quarrying] quarrying for [boulders] boulders , sand mining and unlicensed fishing. 
== Conservation ==
The gharial is listed on [CITES Appendix I] CITES Appendix I . In India, it is protected under the [Wildlife Protection Act of 1972] Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 . In Nepal, it is fully protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973. 
=== Reintroduction programmes ===
Since the late 1970s, the gharial conservation approach was focused on [reintroduction] reintroduction . Rivers in protected areas in India and Nepal used to be restocked with captive bred juvenile gharials. Gharial eggs were incubated, hatched and juvenile gharials raised for two to three years and released when about one metre in length. 
In 1975, the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project was set up under the auspices of the [Government of India] Government of India , initially in Odisha's Satkosia Gorge Sanctuary. It was implemented with financial aid of the [United Nations Development Fund] United Nations Development Fund and the [Food and Agriculture Organization] Food and Agriculture Organization . The country's first gharial breeding center was built in [Nandankanan Zoological Park] Nandankanan Zoological Park . A male gharial was flown in from [Frankfurt Zoological Garden] Frankfurt Zoological Garden to become one of the founding animals of the breeding program. In subsequent years, several protected areas were established. In 1976, two breeding centres were established in Uttar Pradesh, one in [Kukrail Reserve Forest] Kukrail Reserve Forest and one in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, with facilities to hatch and raise up to 800 gharials each year for release in rivers. Between 1975 and 1982, sixteen crocodile rehabilitation centers and five crocodile sanctuaries were established in the country. Gharial eggs were initially purchased from Nepal. In 1991, the Ministry of Environment and Forests withdrew funds for the captive-breeding and egg-collection programs, arguing that the project had served its purpose. In 1997–1998, over 1,200 gharials and over 75 nests were located in the National Chambal Sanctuary, but no surveys were carried out between 1999 and 2003. Gharial eggs collected from wild and captive-breeding nests amounted to 12,000 until 2004. Eggs were incubated, and hatchlings were reared to a length of about one meter or more. More than 5,000 gharials were released into Indian rivers between the early 1980s and 2006. Despite the release of 142 gharials between 1982 and 2007 into the [Ken River] Ken River , only one adult female gharial was observed in the river in spring 2013, indicating that most of the released gharials had not reproduced. Juvenile gharials have also been released into the [Beas River] Beas River in [Punjab, India] Punjab, India . 
In Nepal, wild eggs collected along rivers have been incubated in the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center in [Chitwan National Park] Chitwan National Park since 1978. The first batch of 50 gharials was released in spring 1981 into the Narayani River. In subsequent years, gharials were also released into five other rivers in the country. In 2016, this center was overcrowded with more than 600 gharials aged between 5 and 12 years, and many were too old to be released. Between 1981 and 2018, a total of 1,365 gharials were released in the Rapti–Narayani river system. Reintroducing gharials helped to maintain this population, but the survival rate of released gharials was rather low. Of 36 marked gharials released in the spring seasons of 2002 and 2003 into the Rapti–Narayani rivers, only 14 were found alive in spring 2004. This reintroduction programme has been criticised in 2017 as not being comprehensive and coordinated, as often too old and unsexed gharials were released at disturbed localities during unfavourable cold months and without assessing the efficiency of these releases. It has been suggested to instead leave wild nests in place, increase protection of nesting and basking sites and monitor the movement of gharials. 
Releasing captive-reared gharials did not contribute significantly to re-establishing viable populations. Monitoring of released gharials revealed that the reintroduction programmes did not address multiple factors affecting their survival. These factors include disturbances from diversions of river courses, [sand mining] sand mining , cultivation of riversides, fishing by local people and mortality related to fishing methods like the use of gill nets and [dynamite] dynamite . In 2017, members of the Crocodile Specialist Group therefore recommended to foster engagement of local communities in gharial conservation programs. 
In May 2023, sightings of the Gharial were reported in the Punjab region of Pakistan. This marked the first confirmed sighting of the species in Pakistan after a presumed absence of three decades. In response to these sightings, [WWF-Pakistan] WWF-Pakistan , in collaboration with the other partners, aims to step up [conservation efforts for the Gharial] conservation efforts for the Gharial . The goal is to ensure that the newly discovered population not only survives but thrives. Pakistan has requested the transfer of hundreds of Gharial crocodiles from Nepal in an effort to reintroduce the species. 
=== In situprojects ===
The riverbanks of Girwa river were cleared from woody vegetation on sand banks and mid-river islands in 2019, and sand was added in 2020 to create an artificial sand bank of about 1,000 m (11,000 sq ft). This intervention helped to stabilise and optimise the soil temperature at this site. In 2020, the number of gharial nests on this river stretch increased to 36 from 25 in 2018, and the number of unhatched eggs and dead hatchlings decreased significantly. 
=== In captivity ===
As of 1999, gharials were also kept in the [Madras Crocodile Bank Trust] Madras Crocodile Bank Trust , [Mysore Zoo] Mysore Zoo , [Jaipur Zoo] Jaipur Zoo and Kukrail Gharial Rehabilitation Centre in India. 
In Europe, gharials are kept in [Prague Zoo] Prague Zoo and Protivin Crocodile Zoo in the [Czech Republic] Czech Republic , and the [Berlin Zoo] Berlin Zoo in Germany. La Ferme aux Crocodiles, a crocodile farm in France, received six juveniles in 2000 from the Gharial Breeding Centre in Nepal. 
In the United States, gharials are kept in [Busch Gardens Tampa] Busch Gardens Tampa , [Cleveland Metroparks Zoo] Cleveland Metroparks Zoo , [Fort Worth Zoo] Fort Worth Zoo , [Honolulu Zoo] Honolulu Zoo , [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo , [National Zoological Park] National Zoological Park , [San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium] San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium and [St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park] St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park .  [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo and [Los Angeles Zoo] Los Angeles Zoo received gharials in 2017. In 2023, Fort Worth Zoo announced the birth of four gharials. 
== In culture ==
The earliest known depictions of the gharial date to the [Indus Valley civilisation] Indus Valley civilisation . Seals and tablets show gharials with fish in their mouths and surrounded by fish. A tablet shows a deity flanked by a gharial and a fish. These pieces are about 4,000 years old and were found at [Mohenjo-daro] Mohenjo-daro and [Amri, Sindh] Amri, Sindh . 
A gharial is depicted on one of the rock carvings on a pillar of the [Sanchi] Sanchi  [Stupa] Stupa , which dates to the 3rd century [BC] BC . In [Hindu mythology] Hindu mythology , the gharial is the vehicle of the river deity [Gaṅgā] Gaṅgā and of the wind and sea deity [Varuna] Varuna . 
In the 16th-century book Baburnama [Baburnama] Baburnama , Zahir-ud-din Muhammad [Babur] Babur accounted of a gharial sighting in the Ghaghara River between [Ghazipur] Ghazipur and [Benares] Benares in 1526. 
In 1915, a British officer observed the traditional method of Kehal fishermen hunting gharials along the Indus. They staked nets about 60–75 cm (2 ft 0 in – 2 ft 6 in) below the waterline close by a sandbank and waited hidden for gharials to come out of the river for basking. After some time, they left their hiding places, prompting the gharials to dart off to the river and get entangled in the nets. 
Local people in Nepal attributed various mystical powers to the ghara of male gharials and killed them to collect their snouts.  [Tharu people] Tharu people believed that the ghara would repel insects and pests when burnt in a field, and that gharial eggs would be an effective cough medicine and [aphrodisiac] aphrodisiac . Jewellery found in gharial stomachs may have been the reason for the belief of local people that they would eat humans. 
Local names for the gharial include 'Lamthore gohi' and 'Chimpta gohi' in [Nepali] Nepali , whereby gohi means crocodile; 'Gharial' in [Hindi] Hindi ; 'Susar' in [Marathi] Marathi ; 'Nakar' and 'Bahsoolia nakar' in [Bihari] Bihari ; 'Thantia kumhira' in [Odia] Odia , with 'thantia' being derived from the [Sanskrit] Sanskrit word 'tuṇḍa' meaning beak, snout, elephant's trunk; the male is called 'Ghadiala' and the female 'Thantiana' in Odia.

The kinkajou kinkajou ( [/ˈkɪŋkədʒuː/] /ˈkɪŋkədʒuː/  [KING-kə-joo] KING-kə-joo KING-kə-joo ; Potos flavus Potos flavus Potos flavus ) is a [tropical rainforest] tropical rainforest  [mammal] mammal of the family [Procyonidae] Procyonidae related to [olingos] olingos , [coatis] coatis , [raccoons] raccoons , and the [ringtail] ringtail and [cacomistle] cacomistle . It is the [only member] only member of the [genus] genus  Potos Potos Potos and is also known as the ""honey bear"" (a name that it shares with the unrelated [sun bear] sun bear ). Though kinkajous are [arboreal] arboreal , they are not closely related to any other tree-dwelling mammal group ( [primates] primates , some [mustelids] mustelids , etc.).
Native to Mexico, Central and South America, this mostly [frugivorous] frugivorous mammal is seldom seen by people because of its strict [nocturnal] nocturnal habits. However, it is hunted for the pet trade, for its skin (to make wallets and horse [saddles] saddles ), and for its meat. The species has been included in Appendix III of [CITES] CITES by Honduras, which means that exports from Honduras require an export permit, and exports from other countries require a certificate of origin or of re-export. They may live up to 40 years in [captivity] captivity .
== Etymology ==
The common name ""kinkajou"" derives from [French] French : quincajou quincajou , based on the [Algonquian] Algonquian name for the [wolverine] wolverine . It is similar to the [Ojibwe] Ojibwe word kwi·nkwaʔa·ke kwi·nkwaʔa·ke . Its other names in English include honey bear, night ape, and night walker. Throughout its range, several regional names are used; for instance, the [Dutch] Dutch names nachtaap nachtaap , rolbeer rolbeer , and rolstaartbeer rolstaartbeer are used in Suriname. Many names come from [Portuguese] Portuguese , [Spanish] Spanish , and local dialects, such as jupará jupará , huasa huasa , cuchi cuchi cuchi cuchi , leoncillo leoncillo , marta marta , perro de monte perro de monte , and yapará yapará . 
== Taxonomy ==
A. M. Husson, of the [Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie] Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie ( [Leiden] Leiden ), discussed the rather complicated nomenclature of the kinkajou in The Mammals of Suriname The Mammals of Suriname (1978). In his 1774 work Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur , [Schreber] Schreber listed three items under the name "" Lemur flavus Lemur flavus Penn."": on page 145 is a short translation of [Pennant] Pennant 's [description] description of the yellow maucauco (later identified to be Lemur mongoz Lemur mongoz , presently known as the [mongoose lemur] mongoose lemur ) from his 1771 work A Synopsis of Quadrupeds A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (page 138, second figure on plate 16); on plate 42 is a depiction of the yellow maucauco by Schreber; the last item is a reference to A Synopsis of Quadrupeds A Synopsis of Quadrupeds itself. Husson noted that the last item is actually Pennant's description of an animal that is clearly a kinkajou. Husson therefore concluded that Lemur flavus Lemur flavus is actually a ""composite species"" based on Schreber's specimen of the mongoose lemur and Pennant's specimen of the kinkajou, and identified the latter as the [lectotype] lectotype for the species. The [type locality] type locality reported by Schreber for L. flavus L. flavus (""the mountains in Jamaica"") was clearly based on Pennant's description of the kinkajou, who claimed, however, that his specimen was ""shown about three years ago in London: its keeper said it came from the mountains of Jamaica"". This error was pointed out by [Thomas] Thomas in 1902, who corrected the type locality to Suriname. He used the name Potos flavus Potos flavus for the kinkajou. The genus Potos Potos was erected by [Saint-Hilaire] Saint-Hilaire and [Cuvier] Cuvier in 1795, with the [type species] type species  Viverra caudivolvula Viverra caudivolvula described by Schreber in 1778 (later identified as a [synonym] synonym of Potos flavus Potos flavus ). In 1977 the family Cercoleptidae was proposed with the kinkajou as the sole member, but this classification was later dismissed.

The results showed 27 [haplotypes] haplotypes split into five [clades] clades corresponding to geographical divisions: Costa Rica (clade 1), northern Brazil and the Guianas (clade 2), northern Peru (clade 3), Ecuador and Panama (clade 4), [interfluves] interfluves between the [Branco River] Branco River and [Rio Negro] Rio Negro in the [Brazilian Amazon] Brazilian Amazon , low-lying Amazonian areas (in Bolivia, western Brazil and Peru), and eastern [Atlantic Forest] Atlantic Forest (clade 5). Given the diverse clades, the researchers suggested that some of the subspecies might be independent species. 
== Evolution ==
A 2007 phylogenetic study showed that kinkajous form a [basal] basal lineage [sister] sister to the rest of the [Procyonidae] Procyonidae . They diverged 21.6–24 Mya. Two clades, one leading to Bassaricyon [Bassaricyon] Bassaricyon ( [olingos] olingos and the [olinguito] olinguito ) plus Nasua [Nasua] Nasua (coatis), and one leading to Bassariscus [Bassariscus] Bassariscus (the [ring-tailed cat] ring-tailed cat and the [cacomistle] cacomistle ) plus Procyon [Procyon] Procyon (racoons), appeared subsequently and [radiated] radiated during the [Miocene] Miocene ( [23.8 to 5.3] 23.8 to 5.3 million years ago ). Kinkajous are thought to have evolved in North America and invaded South America as part of the [Great American Interchange] Great American Interchange that followed the formation of the [Isthmus of Panama] Isthmus of Panama . The phylogenetic relationships obtained in the 2007 study are given below; these were supported by similar studies in the following years. 
Bassaricyon [Bassaricyon] Bassaricyon ( [olingos] olingos and [olinguito] olinguito )
Nasua [Nasua] Nasua and Nasuella [Nasuella] Nasuella (coaties)
Procyon [Procyon] Procyon (raccoons)
Bassariscus [Bassariscus] Bassariscus ( [ring-tailed cat] ring-tailed cat and [cacomistle] cacomistle )
Potos Potos Potos (kinkajou)
== Physical characteristics ==
The kinkajou has a round head, large eyes, a short, pointed [snout] snout , short limbs, and a long [prehensile tail] prehensile tail . The total head-and-body length (including the tail) is between 82 and 133 cm (32 and 52 in), and the tail measures 39 to 57 cm (15 to 22 in). Its mature weight ranges from 1.4 to 4.6 kg (3.1 to 10.1 lb). Females are generally smaller than males. The short, rounded ears measure 3.6 to 5.4 cm (1.4 to 2.1 in). The eyes reflect [green or bright yellow] green or bright yellow against light. The long, thick tongue is highly extrudable. The snout is dark brown to black. The claws are sharp and short. 
The coat color varies throughout the range and at different times of the year. Several shades such as tawny olive, wood brown, and yellowish tawny have been reported for the upper part of the coat and the upper side of the tail, while the underparts and the lower side of the tail have been observed to be buff, tawny, or brownish yellow. Some individuals have a black stripe running along the midline of the back. The color seems to become lighter from the south to the north, though no seasonal trends have been observed. The fur is short, woolly and dense. Hairs are of two types - light yellowish and darker with brown tips. The darker hairs reflect light poorly relative to the lighter ones, often creating an illusion of spots and dark lines on the coat. The tail is covered with thick fur up to the end. 
The kinkajou is distinguished from other procyonids by its small, rounded ears, extensible tongue, and prehensile tail. Olingos are similar enough in appearance that many native cultures do not distinguish the two. Compared to olingos, kinkajous are larger, have foreshortened [muzzles] muzzles , and lack [anal scent glands] anal scent glands (in addition to the previously described differences). The [binturong] binturong , a Southeast Asian [viverrid] viverrid , has similar limb proportions and is the only other carnivoran with a prehensile tail. The kinkajou resembles [neotropical monkeys] neotropical monkeys in having a prehensile tail and big, forward-facing eyes, but has a different dentition and heavy fur on the soles of the feet. 
== Range and habitat ==
Kinkajous [range] range from east and south of the [Sierra Madre] Sierra Madre in Mexico, throughout Central America to [Bolivia] Bolivia east of the [Andes] Andes and the [Atlantic Forest] Atlantic Forest of southeastern [Brazil] Brazil . Their altitudinal range is from sea level to 2,500 m. They are found in closed- [canopy] canopy  [tropical forests] tropical forests , including [lowland rainforest] lowland rainforest , [montane forest] montane forest , [dry forest] dry forest , [gallery forest] gallery forest , and [secondary forest] secondary forest . [Deforestation] Deforestation is thus a potential threat to the species. 
== Diet ==
Although the kinkajou is classified in the order [Carnivora] Carnivora and has sharp teeth, its [omnivorous] omnivorous diet consists mainly of fruit, particularly [figs] figs . Some 90% of their diet consists of (primarily ripe) fruit. To eat softer fruits, they hold it with their forepaws, then scoop out the succulent pulp with their tongue. They may play an important role in [seed dispersal] seed dispersal . Leaves, flowers, nectar, and various herbs make up much of the other 10% of their diet. They sometimes eat insects, particularly ants. They may occasionally eat bird eggs and small vertebrates. Their frugivorous habits are actually convergent with those of ( [diurnal] diurnal ) [spider monkeys] spider monkeys . 
The kinkajou's slender 5-inch extrudable [tongue] tongue helps the animal to obtain fruit and to lick [nectar] nectar from flowers, so it sometimes acts as a [pollinator] pollinator . (Nectar is also sometimes obtained by eating entire flowers.) Although captive specimens avidly eat [honey] honey (hence the name ""honey bear""), honey in the diet of wild kinkajous is not well reported. 
== Behavior ==
Kinkajou spend most of their lives in trees, to which they are particularly well adapted. Like [raccoons] raccoons , kinkajous' remarkable manipulatory abilities rival those of [primates] primates . The kinkajou has a short-haired, fully [prehensile tail] prehensile tail (like some [New World monkeys] New World monkeys ), which it uses as a ""fifth hand"" in climbing. It does not use its tail for grasping food. It can rotate its ankles and feet 180°, making it easy for the animal to run backward over tree limbs and climb down trees headfirst.  [Scent glands] Scent glands near the mouth, on the throat, and on the belly allow kinkajous to mark their territory and their travel routes. Kinkajous sleep in family units and [groom] groom one  another. 
While they are usually solitary when foraging, they occasionally forage in large groups, and sometimes associate with olingos (which are also nocturnal arboreal frugivores). The larger kinkajous are dominant and will drive olingos away when food is scarce. Kinkajous have a much more extensive range than olingos and tend to be more common. However, olingos may have greater agility, perhaps facilitating their [sympatry] sympatry with kinkajous.
As a nocturnal animal, the kinkajou's peak activity is usually between about 7:00 pm and midnight, and again an hour before dawn. During daylight hours, kinkajous sleep in tree hollows or in shaded tangles of leaves, avoiding direct sunlight.
Kinkajous breed throughout the year, giving birth to one or occasionally two small babies after a gestation period of 112 to 118 days.
== As pets ==
Kinkajous are sometimes kept as [exotic pets] exotic pets . They are playful, generally quiet, docile, and have little odor, but they can occasionally be aggressive. Kinkajous dislike sudden movements, noise, and being awake during the day. An agitated kinkajou may emit a scream and attack, usually clawing its victim and sometimes biting deeply. In 2011, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that pet kinkajous in the United States can be carriers ( [fecal–oral route] fecal–oral route ) of the raccoon roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis [Baylisascaris procyonis] Baylisascaris procyonis , which is capable of causing severe morbidity and even death in humans if the brain is infected. In 2023, National Geographic reported that escaped kinkajou pets were living in Florida. 
In [El Salvador] El Salvador , [Guatemala] Guatemala , and [Honduras] Honduras , pet kinkajous are commonly called micoleón micoleón , meaning ""lion monkey"". In [Peru] Peru , pet kinkajous are frequently referred to as lirón lirón (the Spanish word for [dormice] dormice ),  often described as a ""bear-monkey"". These names reflect its monkey-like body and obviously carnivoran head.
They typically live about 23 years in captivity, with a maximum recorded lifespan of 42 years.

The markhor markhor ( Capra falconeri Capra falconeri Capra falconeri ) [/ˈmɑːrkɔːr/] / ˈ ˈ m m ɑːr ɑːr k k ɔːr ɔːr / is a large wild [Capra] Capra Capra ( [goat] goat ) species native to [South Asia] South Asia and [Central Asia] Central Asia , mainly within [Pakistan] Pakistan , the [Karakoram] Karakoram range, parts of [Afghanistan] Afghanistan , and the [Himalayas] Himalayas . It is listed on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List as [Near Threatened] Near Threatened since 2015. 
The markhor is the [national animal] national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known as the screw-horn screw-horn or screw-horned goat screw-horned goat . The word mārkhor mārkhor ( مارخور مارخور ), meaning ""snake-eater"", comes from both [Pashto] Pashto and classical [Persian languages] Persian languages , referencing the ancient belief that the markhor would actively kill and consume snakes. This regional myth is believed to stem from the ""snake-like"" form of the male markhor's horns, twisting and curling like a snake, possibly leading ancient peoples to associate them with snakes.
On 2 May 2024, the [United Nations General Assembly] United Nations General Assembly declared 24 May as the International Day of the Markhor. 
== Description ==
Markhor stand 65 to 115 centimetres (26 to 45 in) at the shoulder, are 132 to 186 centimetres (52 to 73 in) long and weigh from 32 to 110 kilograms (71 to 243 lb). They have the highest maximum shoulder height among the species in the genus Capra [Capra] Capra , but is surpassed in length and weight by the [Siberian ibex] Siberian ibex . The coat is of a grizzled, light brown to black colour, and is smooth and short in [summer] summer , while growing longer and thicker in [winter] winter . The fur of the lower legs is black and white. Markhor are [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic , with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to 160 cm (63 in) long, and up to 25 cm (10 in) in females. The males have a pungent smell, which surpasses that of the domestic goat. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Markhor are adapted to mountainous terrain, and can be found between 600 and 3,600 m (2,000 and 11,800 ft) in elevation. They typically inhabit [shrub] shrub forests made up primarily of [oaks] oaks ( Quercus ilex Quercus ilex ), [pines] pines ( Pinus gerardiana Pinus gerardiana ), and [junipers] junipers ( Juniperus macropoda Juniperus macropoda ). They are [diurnal] diurnal , and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: in the spring and summer periods they [graze] graze , but turn to [browsing] browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The [mating season] mating season is during winter, when the males fight each other by lunging, locking of [horns] horns , and attempting to push each other off balance. The [gestation period] gestation period lasts 135–170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, and occasionally three. Markhor live in herds, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19% of the population, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) 9%. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above. In the spring, the females stay closer to cliffs in areas with more rock coverage to provide protection for their offspring. The males stay in higher elevated areas with more access to vegetation for foraging so as to improve their body's condition. 
=== Predators ===
[Eurasian lynx] Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx Lynx lynx ), [snow leopard] snow leopard ( Panthera uncia Panthera uncia ), [Himalayan wolf] Himalayan wolf ( Canis lupus chanco Canis lupus chanco ) and [brown bear] brown bear ( Ursus arctos Ursus arctos ) are the main predators of the markhor. The [golden eagle] golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos Aquila chrysaetos ) has been reported to prey upon young markhor. The markhor possess keen eyesight and a strong sense of smell to detect nearby [predators] predators . Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and on high alert; in exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators. 
== Taxonomy ==
Aegoceros (Capra) Falconeri Aegoceros (Capra) Falconeri was the [scientific name] scientific name proposed by [Johann Andreas Wagner] Johann Andreas Wagner in 1839 based on a female specimen from the Indian Himalayas. 
Multiple subspecies have been recognized, often based on horn configuration, but it has been shown that this can vary greatly even within the same population confined to one mountain range. 
=== Astor markhor ===
The Astor markhor has large, flat horns, branching widely and then going up nearly straight with only a half turn. It is synonymous with Capra falconeri cashmiriensis Capra falconeri cashmiriensis or Pir Panjal markhor Pir Panjal markhor , which has heavy, flat horns, twisted like a corkscrew. The Astor markhor also has a tendency to sexually segregate outside the mating season because of multiple different mechanisms. The females are usually confined to cliffs with less forage coverage, while the males live in areas with a lot more forage coverage. 
Within Afghanistan, the Astor markhor is limited to the east in the high and mountainous monsoon forests of [Laghman] Laghman and [Nuristan] Nuristan . In India, this subspecies is restricted to a portion of the [Pir Panjal] Pir Panjal range in southwestern [Jammu and Kashmir] Jammu and Kashmir . Throughout this range, Astor markhor populations are scattered, starting east of the [Banihal] Banihal Pass (50 km from the [Chenab River] Chenab River ) on the Jammu–Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Recent surveys indicate it still occurs in catchments of the Limber and Lachipora Rivers in the Jhelum Valley Forest Division, and around [Shupiyan] Shupiyan to the south of Srinagar. In [Pakistan] Pakistan , the Astor markhor there is restricted to the [Indus] Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the [Kunar] Kunar (Chitral) River and its tributaries. Along the Indus, it inhabits both banks from Jalkot ( [Kohistan District] Kohistan District ) upstream to near the Tungas village ( [Baltistan] Baltistan ), with Gakuch being its western limit up the [Gilgit River] Gilgit River , Chalt up the [Hunza River] Hunza River , and the Parishing Valley up the [Astore River] Astore River . It has been said to occur on the right side of the [Yasin Valley] Yasin Valley ( [Gilgit District] Gilgit District ), though this is unconfirmed. The flare-horned markhor is also found around [Chitral] Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan, where it inhabits a number of valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and [Drosh] Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the [Mastuj River] Mastuj River . The largest population is currently found in [Chitral National Park] Chitral National Park in Pakistan. 
=== Bukharan markhor ===
Although the Bukharan markhor or Tajik markhur Tajik markhur ( Capra falconeri heptneri Capra falconeri heptneri ) formerly lived in most of the mountains stretching along the north banks of the Upper [Amu Darya] Amu Darya and the [Pyanj] Pyanj Rivers from [Turkmenistan] Turkmenistan to Tajikistan, two to three scattered populations now occur in a greatly reduced distribution. It is limited to the region between lower Pyanj and the [Vakhsh] Vakhsh Rivers near [Kulyab] Kulyab in Tajikistan (near .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct,.mw-parser-output .geo-inline-hidden{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap} .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct,.mw-parser-output .geo-inline-hidden{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap} [38°N70°E﻿ / ﻿38°N 70°E﻿ /38; 70] 38°N 38°N  70°E 70°E ﻿ / ﻿ ﻿ / ﻿ 38°N 70°E 38°N 70°E ﻿ / 38; 70 38; 70 ), and in the Kugitangtau Range in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (around [37°30′N66°40′E﻿ / ﻿37.500°N 66.667°E﻿ /37.500; 66.667] 37°30′N 37°30′N  66°40′E 66°40′E ﻿ / ﻿ ﻿ / ﻿ 37.500°N 66.667°E 37.500°N 66.667°E ﻿ / 37.500; 66.667 37.500; 66.667 ). This subspecies may possibly exist in the [Darwaz] Darwaz Peninsula of northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan. Before 1979, almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution in Afghanistan, and no new information has been established in Afghanistan since that time. 
=== Kabul markhor ===
The [Kabul markhor] Kabul markhor ( Capra falconeri megaceros Capra falconeri megaceros ) has horns with a slight corkscrew, as well as a twist. A [junior synonym] junior synonym is Capra falconeri jerdoni Capra falconeri jerdoni . 
Until 1978, the Kabul markhor survived in Afghanistan only in the [Kabul Gorge] Kabul Gorge and the [Kohe Safi] Kohe Safi area of [Kapissa] Kapissa , and in some isolated pockets in between. It now lives the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range in the mountains of Kapissa and [Kabul Provinces] Kabul Provinces , after having been driven from its original habitat by intensive poaching. In Pakistan, its present range consists only of small isolated areas in [Baluchistan] Baluchistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province and in [Dera Ghazi Khan District] Dera Ghazi Khan District ( [Punjab Province] Punjab Province ). The KPK Forest Department considered that the areas of [Mardan] Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. At least 100 animals are thought to live on the Pakistani side of the [Safed Koh] Safed Koh range (Districts of [Kurram] Kurram and [Khyber] Khyber ). 
=== Relationship with the domestic goat ===
Certain authors have postulated that the markhor is the ancestor of some breeds of [domestic goat] domestic goat . The [Angora goat] Angora goat has been regarded by some as a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor.  [Charles Darwin] Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding markhor with [wild goats] wild goats . Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have suggested that markhor may have been the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, based on their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the markhor belies any close relationship. The [Changthangi] Changthangi domestic goat of [Ladakh] Ladakh and [Tibet] Tibet may derive from the markhor. The [Girgentana goat] Girgentana goat of [Sicily] Sicily is thought to have been bred from markhor, as is the [Bilberry goat] Bilberry goat of [Ireland] Ireland . The Kashmiri [feral] feral herd of about 200 individuals on the [Great Orme] Great Orme  [limestone] limestone  [headland] headland of [Wales] Wales are derived from a herd maintained at [Windsor Great Park] Windsor Great Park belonging to [Queen Victoria] Queen Victoria . 
Fecal samples taken from markhor and domestic goats indicate that there is a serious level of competition for food between the two species. The competition for food between herbivores is believed to have significantly reduced the standing crop of forage in the Himalaya–Karkoram–Hindukush ranges. Domestic livestock have an advantage over wild herbivores since the density of their herds often pushes their competitors out of the best grazing areas, and decreased forage availability has a negative effect on female fertility. 
== Threats ==
Hunting for meat as a means of subsistence or trade in wildlife parts adds to the growing problem for wildlife managers in many countries. [Poaching] Poaching , with its indirect impacts as disturbance, increasing fleeing distances and resulting reduction of effective habitat size, is by far the most important factor threatening the survival of the markhor populations. The most important types of poachers seem to be local inhabitants, state border guards, the latter usually relying on local hunting guides, and Afghans, illegally crossing the border. Poaching causes fragmentation of the population into small islands where the remaining subpopulations are prone to extinction. The markhor is a valued trophy hunting prize for its spiral horns. The Pakistani government issued several tags in an attempt to save the species, which since the introduction of hunting the species has seen a remarkable rebound. The continuing declines of markhor populations finally caught the attention of the international community. 
=== Hunting ===
In [British India] British India , markhor were considered to be among the most challenging game species, because of the danger involved in stalking and pursuing them in high, mountainous terrain. According to Arthur Brinckman in his The Rifle in Cashmere The Rifle in Cashmere , ""a man who is a good walker will never wish for any finer sport than [ibex] ibex or markhoor shooting"".  [Elliot Roosevelt] Elliot Roosevelt wrote of how he shot two markhor in 1881, his first on 8 July, his second on 1 August. Although it is illegal to hunt markhor in Afghanistan, they have been traditionally hunted in [Nuristan] Nuristan and [Laghman] Laghman Provinces, and this may have intensified during the [War in Afghanistan] War in Afghanistan . In Pakistan, hunting markhor is legal as part of a conservation process: expensive hunting licenses are available from the Pakistani government that allow the hunting of old markhors, which are no longer good for breeding purposes. In India, it is illegal to hunt markhor but they are poached for food and for their horns, which are thought to have medicinal properties. Markhor have also been successfully introduced to private game ranches in [Texas] Texas . Unlike the [aoudad] aoudad , [blackbuck] blackbuck , [nilgai] nilgai , [ibex] ibex , and [axis deer] axis deer , however, markhor have not escaped in sufficient numbers to establish free-range wild populations in Texas.
The [International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources] International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources currently classifies the markhor as a [near threatened] near threatened species, because of its relatively small population (2013 estimate: ~5,800 individuals), the absence of a projected total population decline, and its reliance on ongoing conservation efforts to maintain population levels. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers markhor protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the markhor population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as [habitat destruction] habitat destruction . Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainably exploit the markhor species. This approach has been effective compared to the protection of lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir's Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978. 
== In culture ==
The markhor is the [national animal] national animal of [Pakistan] Pakistan . It was one of the 72 animals featured on the [World Wide Fund for Nature Conservation Coin Collection] World Wide Fund for Nature Conservation Coin Collection in 1976. Markhor [marionettes] marionettes are used in the Afghan [puppet] puppet shows known as buz-baz [buz-baz] buz-baz . The markhor has also been mentioned in a [Pakistani] Pakistani  [computer-animated film] computer-animated film known as Allahyar and the Legend of Markhor [Allahyar and the Legend of Markhor] Allahyar and the Legend of Markhor . 
=== Etymology ===
The name is thought to be derived from [Persian language] Persian language — a conjunction of mâr mâr mâr ( مار [مار] مار , "" [snake] snake , [serpent] serpent "") and the suffix khor khor khor ( ‏خور‎ [‏خور‎] ‏خور‎ , ""-eater""), interpreted to represent the animal's alleged ability to kill snakes, or as a reference to its corkscrew-like horns, which are somewhat reminiscent of coiling snakes. 
In folklore the markhor is believed to kill and eat serpents. Thereafter, while chewing the [cud] cud , a foam-like substance comes out of its mouth that drops on the ground and dries. This foam-like substance is sought after by the local people, who believe it is useful in extracting the poison from snakebites.

Cassowary,Cassowary,"
Cassowaries Cassowaries ( [Indonesian] Indonesian : kasuari kasuari , [Biak] Biak : man suar man suar  ' ' bird strong bird strong ' ' ,  [Tok Pisin] Tok Pisin : muruk muruk , [Papuan] Papuan :  kasu weri kasu weri  ' ' horned head horned head ' ' ) are [flightless birds] flightless birds of the genus Casuarius Casuarius Casuarius in the order [Casuariiformes] Casuariiformes . They are classified as [ratites] ratites : flightless birds without a [keel] keel on their [sternum] sternum bones. Cassowaries are native to the [tropical forests] tropical forests of [New Guinea] New Guinea ( [Western New Guinea] Western New Guinea and [Papua New Guinea] Papua New Guinea ), [The Moluccas] The Moluccas ( [Seram] Seram and [Aru Islands] Aru Islands ), and northeastern [Australia] Australia . 
Three cassowary species are [extant] extant . The most common, the [southern cassowary] southern cassowary , is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the [ostrich] ostrich and [emu] emu . The other two species are represented by the [northern cassowary] northern cassowary and the [dwarf cassowary] dwarf cassowary ; the northern cassowary is the most recently discovered and the most threatened. A fourth but extinct species is represented by the [pygmy cassowary] pygmy cassowary .
Cassowaries are very wary of humans, but if provoked, they are capable of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries. They are known to attack both [dogs] dogs and people. The cassowary has often been labelled ""the world's most dangerous bird"", although in terms of recorded statistics, it pales in comparison to the [common ostrich] common ostrich , which is recorded to kill two to three humans per year in [South Africa] South Africa . 
== Taxonomy, systematics, and evolution ==
The [genus] genus  Casuarius Casuarius was erected by French scientist [Mathurin Jacques Brisson] Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Ornithologie Ornithologie Ornithologie published in 1760. The [type species] type species is the [southern cassowary] southern cassowary ( Casuarius casuarius Casuarius casuarius ). The Swedish naturalist [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus Casuarius Casuarius in the sixth edition of his Systema Naturae Systema Naturae [Systema Naturae] Systema Naturae published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important [tenth edition] tenth edition of 1758 and put the southern cassowary together with the [common ostrich] common ostrich and the [greater rhea] greater rhea in the genus Struthio [Struthio] Struthio . As the publication date of Linnaeus's sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the [International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature] International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature , Brisson, and not Linnaeus, is considered the authority for the genus. 
Cassowaries (from [Malay] Malay : kasuari kasuari cognate of several [related languages] related languages spoken around the [Moluccas] Moluccas and [New Guinea] New Guinea ) are part of the [ratite] ratite group, which also includes the emu, [rheas] rheas , ostriches, and [kiwi] kiwi , as well as the extinct [moas] moas and [elephant birds] elephant birds . These species are recognised:
[] 

[] 

[] 




Most authorities consider the taxonomic classification above to be [monotypic] monotypic , but several [subspecies] subspecies of each have been described, and some of them have even been suggested as separate species, e.g., C. (b) papuanus C. (b) papuanus . The taxonomic name C. (b) papuanus C. (b) papuanus also may be in need of revision to Casuarius (bennetti) westermanni Casuarius (bennetti) westermanni . Validation of these subspecies has proven difficult due to individual variations, age-related variations, the scarcity of [specimens] specimens , the stability of specimens (the bright skin of the head and neck—the basis of describing several subspecies—fades in specimens), and the practice of trading live cassowaries for thousands of years, some of which are likely to have escaped or been deliberately [introduced] introduced to regions away from their origin. 
The evolutionary history of cassowaries, as of all ratites, is not well known. Genetic evidence suggests that their closest living relatives are [emus] emus , and that the dwarf cassowary is more closely related to the Northern Cassowary than either is to the Southern cassowary. A fossil species was reported from Australia, but for reasons of [biogeography] biogeography , this assignment is not certain, and it might belong to the prehistoric Emuarius [Emuarius] Emuarius , which was a genus of cassowary-like primitive emus.
== Description ==
Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they are there. The southern cassowary of the far north [Queensland] Queensland  [rain forests] rain forests is not well studied, and the northern and dwarf cassowaries even less so. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than the males. Adult southern cassowaries are 1.5 to 1.8 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, although some females may reach .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 2 m (6 ft 6 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 in), and weigh 58.5 kg (130 lb). However, it is not uncommon to see exceptionally large females topping the scales beyond 70 kg (150 lb), with the largest maximum recorded being a [southern cassowary] southern cassowary at 85 kg (187 lb) and 190 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall.
Hence, by technicality, all three species of cassowaries are considered as Asia's largest bird since the extinction of the [Arabian ostrich] Arabian ostrich . Moreover, not only is the cassowary Asia's largest bird, within [New Guinea] New Guinea , the cassowary is the island's second largest terrestrial animal after the introduction of [Cervidaes] Cervidaes such as the [rusa deer] rusa deer , [chital] chital , and [fallow deer] fallow deer . 
All cassowaries' feathers consist of a shaft and loose barbules. They do not have [rectrices] rectrices (tail feathers) or a [preen gland] preen gland . Cassowaries have small wings with five or six large [remiges] remiges . These are reduced to stiff, [keratinous] keratinous quills, resembling porcupine quills, with no barbs. The [furcula] furcula and [coracoid] coracoid are degenerate, and their [palatal] palatal bones and [sphenoid] sphenoid bones touch each other. These, along with their wedge-shaped body, are thought to be adaptations to ward off vines, thorns, and saw-edged leaves, allowing them to run quickly through the rainforest. 
Unlike the majority of birds, cassowaries lack a tongue. Their beaks are pointed, sharp and robust but not serrated, which allows them to pick up fruit or small animals more easily than the short bills of an [emu] emu or an [ostrich] ostrich . 
Cassowaries have three- [toed] toed feet with sharp [claws] claws . The inner (first) toe has a [dagger] dagger -like claw that may be 125 mm (5 in) long. This claw is particularly fearsome, since cassowaries [sometimes kick humans and other animals] sometimes kick humans and other animals with their powerful legs. Cassowaries can run at up to 50 km/h (30 mph) through the dense forest and can jump up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in). They are good swimmers, crossing wide rivers and swimming in the sea. 
All three species have a keratinous, skin-covered [casque] casque on their heads that grows with age. The casque's shape and size, up to 18 cm (7 in), is species-dependent. C. casuarius C. casuarius has the largest and C. bennetti C. bennetti the smallest (tricorn shape), with C. unappendiculatus C. unappendiculatus having variations in between. Contrary to earlier findings, the hollow inside of the casque is spanned with fine fibres. 
Several functions for the casque have been proposed. One is that they are a [secondary sexual characteristic] secondary sexual characteristic . Other suggested functions include batting through the underbrush, as a weapon in dominance disputes, or pushing aside leaf litter during foraging. The latter three are disputed by biologist Andrew Mack, whose personal observation suggests that the casque amplifies deep sounds. This is related to a discovery that at least the dwarf cassowary and southern cassowary produce very low-frequency sounds, which may aid in communication in dense rainforests. The ""boom"" vocalization that cassowaries produce is the lowest-frequency bird call known and is at the lower limit of human hearing. Recent study suggests that casque acts as a thermal radiator, offloading heat at high temperatures and restricting heat loss at low temperatures. 
The average lifespan of wild cassowaries is approximately 18–20 years, with those held in captivity living up to 40 years. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Cassowaries are solitary birds except during courtship, egg-laying, and sometimes around ample food supplies. Males and females each maintain separate territories that overlap, of a size of approximately 3 square kilometres in one study. While females move among satellite territories of different males, they appear to remain within the same territories for most of their lives, mating with the same, or closely related, males over the course of their lives. 
Courtship and pair-bonding rituals begin with the vibratory sounds broadcast by females. Males approach and run with their necks parallel to the ground while making dramatic movements of their heads, which accentuate the frontal neck region. The female approaches drumming slowly. The male crouches on the ground, and the female either steps on the male's back for a moment before crouching beside him in preparation for copulation, or she may attack. This is often the case with the females pursuing the males in ritualistic chasing behaviours that generally terminate in water. The male cassowary dives into water and submerges himself up to his upper neck and head. The female pursues him into the water, where he eventually drives her to the shallows, where she crouches making ritualistic motions of her head. The two may remain in copulation for extended periods of time. In some cases, another male may approach and run off the first male. He will climb onto her to copulate, as well. 
Both male and female cassowaries do not tolerate the presence of others of the same sex, but females are more prone to fight than males, which will generally flee when encountering another male. While males and females may also be territorial and confrontational, this decreases during the mating season 
=== Reproduction ===
The cassowary breeding season starts in May to June. Females lay three to eight large, bright green or pale green-blue [eggs] eggs in each clutch into a heap of leaf litter prepared by the male. The eggs measure about 9 by 14 cm (3.5 by 5.5 in) – only ostrich and emu eggs are larger.
The male [incubates] incubates those eggs for 50–52 days, removing or adding litter to regulate the temperature, then protects the chicks, which stay in the nest for about 9 months. He defends them fiercely against all potential predators, including humans. The young males later go off to find a territory of their own. 
The female does not care for the eggs or the chicks, but rather moves on within her territory to lay eggs in the nests of several other males. Young cassowaries are brown and have buffy stripes. They are often kept as pets in native villages (in New Guinea), where they are permitted to roam like barnyard fowl until nearing maturity. Caged birds are regularly bereft of their fresh plumes. 
=== Diet ===
Cassowaries, as aforementioned, are predominantly [frugivorous] frugivorous , but [omnivorous] omnivorous opportunistically when small prey is available. Besides fruits, their diet includes flowers, fungi, snails, insects, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds, fish, rats, mice, small marsupials and [carrion] carrion , although their hunting of small prey is more akin to foraging if they could catch them. Their diverse diet allows the cassowary to adapt to the availability of different food sources in their environment in case of ecological disruption. Despite their similar omnivorous foraging behaviour, cassowaries and introduced [wild boars] wild boars had co-existed for thousands of years in [New Guinea] New Guinea , even though it should have dictated that both species should be in direct competition such as in the case in the cassowary population in [Queensland] Queensland , [Australia] Australia .
Fruit from at least 26 plant families has been documented in the diet of cassowaries. Fruits from the [laurel] laurel , [podocarp] podocarp , palm, wild grape, [nightshade] nightshade , and myrtle families are important items in the diet. The poisonous [cassowary plum] cassowary plum takes its name from the bird. The bird avoids the poisons of these fruits due to the presence of their incredibly short gastrointestinal tract, the shortest of all ratites in relation to their size. The cassowary's incredibly short and simple digestive tract leads to a short gut retention time which allow seeds to remain unharmed during the comparatively soft digestion process and allows them to consume fruits that contain toxins such as [cyanogens] cyanogens . This short gut length also allows the birds to eat a wider variety of protein source, which is unsurprising given their omnivorous diet.
Where trees are dropping fruit, cassowaries come in and feed, with each bird defending a tree from others for a few days. They move on when the fruit is depleted. Fruit, even items as large as [bananas] bananas and apples, is swallowed whole. Cassowaries are a [keystone species] keystone species of rain forests because they eat fallen fruit whole and distribute seeds across the jungle floor via excrement. 
Adult and young cassowaries also practice [coprophagia] coprophagia . As adult waste often contain half-digested fruit which still has nutritional value, so the birds would devour each other's as well as their own droppings. 
In more urbanised areas, especially in [Queensland] Queensland , [Australia] Australia , 'urbanised' cassowaries have adopted to also feed on picnic blankets, tables and baskets or backyard bird feeders and compost heaps, thereby consuming a wide range of non-natural and non-native foods as well. In fact, cassowaries are known to eat non-edible items—in one case, collection of urban cassowary droppings resulted in many unusual items. Outside of the skeletal remains of a [honeyeater] honeyeater , which was likely preyed by the cassowary, researchers also found remains of a child’s coloured building blocks, various sized marbles and a very small plastic car that came from a cereal packet. In terms of roadkill, discarded fish was reported, but the most common type of roadkill eaten by cassowaries are [bandicoots] bandicoots , which potentially represent the largest prey item consumed by the birds. 
In captivity, cassowaries get the majority of their protein source from dog or monkey food. In fact, captive cassowaries consume almost 1 L (0.22 imp gal; 0.26 US gal) of a protein source (such as dog food) in conjunction with 19 L (4.2 imp gal; 5.0 US gal) of fruit a day, which results in 5% of their overall diet. 
=== Role in seed dispersal and germination ===
Cassowaries feed on the fruit of several hundred rainforest species and usually pass viable seeds in large, dense [scats] scats . They are known to disperse seeds over distances greater than a kilometre, thus playing an important role in the ecosystem. Germination rates for seeds of the rare Australian rainforest tree Ryparosa [Ryparosa] Ryparosa were found to be much higher after passing through a cassowary's gut (92% versus 4%). 
=== Threats ===
In its main home of [New Guinea] New Guinea , cassowaries are the island's largest and most dominant and formidable [bird] bird , as well as being one of the largest terrestrial endemic animals in New Guinea. As such, adult cassowaries have no natural enemies other than [humans] humans (and even then, the birds are rarely hunted due to their reputation, speed, wariness and self-defence, with juveniles being preferred over adults for ceremonial purposes - on average, it is considered very fortunate for a human hunter to kill one in every five years ). With regards to their relationship with the [New Guinea singing dogs] New Guinea singing dogs - one of Papua's only obligate terrestrial apex predator, with the other being the [crocodile monitor] crocodile monitor - adult birds generally ignore them, with some even believing that the dogs take full advantage of the birds' foraging behaviour, as both species share and use the same feeding trail through the forests. It was believed that these dogs follow adult birds to catch small prey attracted to the dropped fruits on the rainforest floor. Nevertheless, there was a report from a native hunter of an exceptionally rare case of a singing dog attacking the [dwarf species] dwarf species . The incident ended with the singing dog being disemboweled and ripped open by the bird. But generally speaking, both apex animals mutually keep their distance and avoid one another. 
The same cannot be said with their chicks, however, as they are vulnerable to large [pythons] pythons , [monitor lizards] monitor lizards , [New Guinea singing dogs] New Guinea singing dogs , and [Papuan eagles] Papuan eagles . When threatened, it is known that cassowary chicks emit different vocalisation calls to indicate the specific threat, such as a hawk for example, before running underneath their father. Adult males aggressively defend their chicks. While adult males usually scare off or kill most predators, a chick will occasionally be separated in the chaos and become a potential target. 
However, in the relic populations of north-eastern [Australia] Australia , the cassowary population faces threats from [vehicles] vehicles , and are in danger of being outcompeted by [wild boars] wild boars , with their eggs being most vulnerable to boar predation. Their chicks also face dangers and predation from [domesticated dogs] domesticated dogs , which results in a widespread decline in the Australian mainland. Because of such frequent inter-species conflicts, hunting dogs are one of the biggest enemies for cassowaries, and it is not unheard of for hunting dogs to accidentally kill cassowary chicks instead of feral pigs, with the dogs in-turn, being killed by the nearby adult rooster. Outside of threats from invasive species, the birds are also vulnerable to being unintentionally poisoned as well. [Rodents] Rodents are a popular prey item for the birds due to their commonality, ease of catch and being a good protein source. However, rodents that died from [rat poisoning] rat poisoning would themselves, become lethal poison to the birds which are unaware from this contaminated danger. It is unknown why the cassowary population in Australia is in decline, as the New Guinea population has dealt with introduced [wild boars] wild boars , [dogs] dogs and [feral cats] feral cats for thousands of years longer with little to no impact on its population, suggesting that either the cassowaries of New Guinea had long adapted to human-introduced species or that the rich biodiversity of New Guinea allowed for additional [niche partitioning] niche partitioning . 
As for eating the cassowary, it is supposed to be quite tough. Australian administrative officers stationed in New Guinea were advised that it ""should be cooked with a stone in the pot: when the stone is ready to eat, so is the cassowary"". 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Cassowaries are native to the humid rainforests of New Guinea, nearby smaller islands, [East Nusa Tenggara] East Nusa Tenggara , the [Maluku Islands] Maluku Islands , and northeastern Australia. They do, however, venture out into palm scrub, [grassland] grassland , [savanna] savanna , and swamp forest. The wild population of cassowaries is threatened by deforestation, hunting, and habitat destruction. Human presence and agricultural activities have also contributed to the decline of their population in some areas. To protect this species, various conservation efforts have been carried out, including preserving natural habitat and enforcing regulations against illegal hunting. In Indonesia, cassowaries are predominantly found in the rainforests of Papua, particularly in lowland and montane areas. In addition, cassowaries are known to inhabit protected areas such as [Wasur National Park] Wasur National Park in Merauke and [Lorentz National Park] Lorentz National Park , which is the largest national park in Southeast Asia, encompassing a vast range of ecosystems from coastal to alpine environments. These birds play a critical ecological role in seed dispersal, contributing to the regeneration of forests in these protected areas. They can also be easily spotted in some national parks such as Mellwraith Range National Park, [Paluma Range National Park] Paluma Range National Park , and Jardine National Park in Australia. 
== Status and conservation ==
The southern cassowary is endangered in Queensland. Kofron and Chapman, when they assessed the decline of this species, found that of the former cassowary habitat, only 20–25% remains. Habitat loss and fragmentation is the primary cause of decline. They then studied 140 cases of cassowary mortality, and found that motor-vehicle strikes accounted for 55% of the deaths, and dog attacks produced another 18%. Remaining causes of death included hunting (five cases), entanglement in wire (one case), the removal of cassowaries that attacked humans (four cases), and natural causes (18 cases), including tuberculosis (four cases). The cause for 14 cases was indicated as ""for unknown reasons"". 
Hand feeding cassowaries poses a significant threat to their survival because it lures them into suburban areas. There, the birds are more susceptible to encounters with vehicles and dogs. Contact with humans encourages cassowaries to take food from picnic tables. [Feral pigs] Feral pigs also are a significant threat to their survival. They destroy nests and eggs of cassowaries, but their worst effect is as competitors for food, which may be catastrophic for the cassowaries during lean times. 
In February 2011, [Cyclone Yasi] Cyclone Yasi destroyed a large area of cassowary habitat, endangering 200 of the birds – about 10% of the total Australian population. 
The Mission Beach community in far north Queensland holds an annual Cassowary Festival in September, where funds are raised to map the bird's habitat. 
Ironically, despite being a threatened species in Queensland, concerns also mount on cassowaries being itself, a potential invasive species on the island of [Tasmania] Tasmania . According to the [Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment] Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment from [Hobart] Hobart , risk assessments on the cassowary as a potential invasive pest states that whilst the birds may have trouble establishing a stable population on the island, they would nonetheless, be considered a destructive element to Tasmania's ecological diversity and recommends strict imports on these birds. Reasons are many. The most notable are the birds' size. Cassowaries would automatically become the island's largest and most dominant terrestrial animal that could bully smaller animals in the same ecological niche. Frugivores such as the [common brushtail possum] common brushtail possum , [common ringtail possum] common ringtail possum , [eastern pygmy possum] eastern pygmy possum and the [little pygmy possum] little pygmy possum would be denied access to fruit of which they depend upon. 
However, since Tasmania lack the same levels of fruit diversity as Queensland and New Guinea, assessments believe that the birds would adapt by also eating invertebrates and small vertebrates. This may lead to some competition with the island's endemic insectivores such as the [eastern quoll] eastern quoll , [southern brown bandicoot] southern brown bandicoot , and [eastern barred bandicoot] eastern barred bandicoot . 
== In captivity ==
The cassowary has solitary habits and breeds less frequently in zoos than other ratites such as ostrich and emu. Unlike other ratites, it lives exclusively in tropical rainforest, and reproducing this habitat carefully is essential. Unlike the emu, which will live with other [sympatric] sympatric species, such as [kangaroos] kangaroos , in ""mixed Australian fauna"" displays, the cassowary does not cohabit well among its own kind. Individual specimens must even be kept in separate enclosures, due to their solitary and aggressive nature. Territoriality is one of their most important characteristics.
The double-wattled cassowary ( C. casuarius C. casuarius ) is the most popular species in captivity, and it is fairly common in European and American zoos, where it is known for its unmistakable appearance. As of 2019 , only [Weltvogelpark Walsrode] Weltvogelpark Walsrode in Germany has all three species of cassowaries in its collection: single-wattled cassowary ( Casuarius unappendiculatus Casuarius unappendiculatus ) and Bennett's cassowary ( Casuarius bennetti Casuarius bennetti ). If subspecies are recognised, Weltvogelpark Walsrode has C. b. westermanni C. b. westermanni and C. u. rufotinctus C. u. rufotinctus .
== Relationship with humans ==
=== Role in Papuan cultures and semi-domestication ===
There is evidence that the cassowary may have been domesticated by humans thousands of years before the chicken. Some New Guinea Highlands societies capture cassowary chicks and raise them as semi-tame poultry, for use in ceremonial gift exchanges and as food. They are the only indigenous Australasian animal known to have been partly domesticated by people prior to European arrival and colonization and by definition, the oldest form of domesticated animal and the largest domesticated bird. The Maring people of Kundagai sacrificed cassowaries ( C. bennetti C. bennetti ) in certain rituals. The Kalam people considered themselves related to cassowaries, and did not classify them as birds, but as kin. Consequently, they use the [Pandanus register] Pandanus register of the [Kalam language] Kalam language when eating cassowary meat. 
Studies on [Pleistocene] Pleistocene /early [Holocene] Holocene cassowary remains in Papua suggest that indigenous people at the time preferred to harvest eggs rather than adults. They seem to have regulated their consumption of these birds, possibly even collecting eggs and rearing young birds as one of the earliest forms of domestication. 
=== Urbanisation of local cassowary population ===
In extremely urbanised areas where Cassowaries used to naturally live such as in Queensland, Australia or in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, the local Cassowary population had adapted to its less forested grounds. Increasing urbanisation has increased the likelihood of human-cassowary interaction, a potentially dangerous mix. Although cassowary populations have faced challenges in these urban areas in Northeastern Australia and parts of New Guinea, the cassowaries have proven to be surprisingly quite adaptable in contrast to the [Kiwis] Kiwis of [New Zealand] New Zealand , potentially making them the largest urbanised birds in the world.
It was found that cassowaries in these urban environments changed their diets accordingly, with urbanised cassowaries actually consuming an even greater proportion of fruits from exotic plants (~30%) but still incorporating a significant proportion of fruits from native plants in their diet. Likewise, as aforementioned, the high concentration of human activity in the urban ecology also equates to a higher concentration of food diversity and food waste, with these 'urbanised' cassowaries foraging for food scraps, bird feeders and outdoor picnic/food venues without fear from humans or domesticated animals due to the birds' size and reputation. 
Due to their omnivorous nature, cassowaries are able to eat all types of human food, including processed ones if they feel like it, although fruit still remains their favourite choosings. A 2013 study from post-mortem investigations found that a combination of fruit scarcity and abundancy in human waste saw the diet of the cassowary intaking vast quantities of non-fruit items, this include fungus, carrion, meat, cheese, bones, pasta, chilli and tomato. The high concentration of human activity as well as vehicles, mixed with domesticated animals and less forest coverage, had also changed their behaviours. These 'city' cassowaries were shown to exist in a higher state of activity and rested less than individuals inhabiting more intact swathes of rainforest, actively moving between urban gardens and the rainforest. The study give evidence that these birds showed a surprising amount of flexible foraging strategy that has enabled them to persist in rainforest-fragmented landscapes. 
=== Attacks ===
Cassowaries have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animals. During [World War II] World War II , American and Australian troops stationed in New Guinea were warned to steer clear of them. In his 1958 book Living Birds of the World Living Birds of the World , ornithologist [Ernest Thomas Gilliard] Ernest Thomas Gilliard wrote:
The inner or second of the three toes is fitted with a long, straight, murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease. There are many records of natives being killed by this bird.
This assessment of the danger posed by cassowaries has been repeated in print by authors, including [Gregory S. Paul] Gregory S. Paul and [Jared Diamond] Jared Diamond . A 2003 historical study of 221 cassowary attacks showed that 150 had been against humans; 75% of these had been from cassowaries that had been fed by people, 71% of the time the bird had chased or charged the victim, and 15% of the time they kicked. Of the attacks, 73% involved the birds expecting or snatching food, 5% involved defending their natural food sources, 15% involved defending themselves, and 7% involved defending their chicks or eggs. Only one human death was reported among those 150 attacks. 
The first documented human death caused by a cassowary was on April 6, 1926. In Australia, 16-year-old Phillip McClean and his brother, age 13, came across a cassowary on their property and decided to try to kill it by striking it with clubs. The bird kicked the younger boy, who fell and ran away as his older brother struck the bird. The older McClean then tripped and fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, the cassowary kicked him in the neck, opening a 1.25-centimetre (0.49 in) wound that severed his [jugular vein] jugular vein . The boy died of his injuries shortly thereafter. 
Cassowary strikes to the abdomen are among the rarest of all, but in one case in 1995, a dog was kicked in the belly. The blow left no puncture, but severe bruising occurred. The dog later died from an apparent intestinal rupture. 
Another human death due to a cassowary was recorded in Florida on April 12, 2019. The bird's owner, a 75-year-old man who had raised the animal, was apparently clawed to death after he fell to the ground.

Tasmanian Devil,Tasmanian devil,"
The Tasmanian devil Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii Sarcophilus harrisii Sarcophilus harrisii ) ( [palawa kani] palawa kani : purinina purinina ) is a carnivorous [marsupial] marsupial of the family [Dasyuridae] Dasyuridae . It was formerly present across mainland Australia, but became extinct there around 3,500 years ago; it is now confined to the island of [Tasmania] Tasmania . The size of a small dog, the Tasmanian devil became the [largest carnivorous marsupial] largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the [extinction] extinction of the [thylacine] thylacine in 1936. It is related to [quolls] quolls , and distantly related to the thylacine. It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding. The Tasmanian devil's large head and neck allow it to generate among the strongest bites per unit body mass of any extant predatory land mammal. It hunts prey and scavenges on [carrion] carrion .
Although devils are usually solitary, they sometimes eat and defecate together in a communal location. Unlike most other [dasyurids] dasyurids , the devil [thermoregulates] thermoregulates effectively, and is active during the middle of the day without overheating. Despite its rotund appearance, it is capable of surprising speed and endurance, and can climb trees and swim across rivers. Devils are not [monogamous] monogamous . Males fight one another for females, and guard their partners to prevent female infidelity. Females can ovulate three times in as many weeks during the [mating season] mating season , and 80% of two-year-old females are seen to be pregnant during the annual mating season.
Females average four breeding seasons in their life, and give birth to 20 to 30 live young after three weeks' gestation. The newborn are pink, lack fur, have indistinct facial features, and weigh around 0.20 g (0.0071 oz) at birth. As there are only four nipples in the pouch, competition is fierce, and few newborns survive. The young grow rapidly, and are ejected from the pouch after around 100 days, weighing roughly 200 g (7.1 oz). The young become independent after around nine months.
In 1941, devils became officially protected. Since the late 1990s, the [devil facial tumour disease] devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has drastically reduced the population and now threatens the survival of the species, which in 2008 was declared to be [endangered] endangered . Starting in 2013, Tasmanian devils are again being sent to zoos around the world as part of the [Australian government] Australian government 's Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The devil is an iconic symbol of Tasmania and many organisations, groups and products associated with the state use the animal in their logos. It is seen as an important attractor of tourists to Tasmania and has come to worldwide attention through the Looney Tunes [Looney Tunes] Looney Tunes character [of the same name] of the same name .
== Taxonomy ==
Believing it to be a type of [opossum] opossum , naturalist [George Harris] George Harris wrote the first published description of the Tasmanian devil in 1807, naming it Didelphis ursina Didelphis ursina , due to its bearlike characteristics such as the round ear. He had earlier made a presentation on the topic at the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London . However, that particular binomial name had been given to the [common wombat] common wombat (later reclassified as Vombatus ursinus Vombatus ursinus ) by [George Shaw] George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable. In 1838, a specimen was named Dasyurus laniarius Dasyurus laniarius by [Richard Owen] Richard Owen , but by 1877 he had relegated it to Sarcophilus Sarcophilus . The modern Tasmanian devil was named Sarcophilus harrisii Sarcophilus harrisii (""Harris's flesh-lover"") by French naturalist [Pierre Boitard] Pierre Boitard in 1841. 
A later revision of the devil's taxonomy, published in 1987, attempted to change the species name to Sarcophilus laniarius [Sarcophilus laniarius] Sarcophilus laniarius based on mainland fossil records of only a few animals. However, this was not accepted by the taxonomic community at large; the name S. harrisii S. harrisii has been retained and S. laniarius S. laniarius relegated to a fossil species. "" [Beelzebub] Beelzebub 's pup"" was an early vernacular name given to it by the explorers of Tasmania, in reference to a religious figure who is a prince of hell and an assistant of [Satan] Satan ; the explorers first encountered the animal by hearing its far-reaching vocalisations at night. Related names that were used in the 19th century were Sarcophilus satanicus Sarcophilus satanicus (""Satanic flesh-lover"") and Diabolus ursinus Diabolus ursinus (""bear devil""), all due to early misconceptions of the species as implacably vicious. The Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii Sarcophilus harrisii ) belongs to the family [Dasyuridae] Dasyuridae . The genus Sarcophilus Sarcophilus contains two other species, known only from [Pleistocene] Pleistocene fossils: S. laniarius S. laniarius and S. moomaensis S. moomaensis . [Phylogenetic] Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Tasmanian devil is most closely related to [quolls] quolls . 
According to Pemberton, the possible ancestors of the devil may have needed to climb trees to acquire food, leading to a growth in size and the hopping gait of many marsupials. He speculated that these adaptations may have caused the contemporary devil's peculiar gait. The specific lineage of the Tasmanian devil is theorised to have emerged during the [Miocene] Miocene , molecular evidence suggesting a split from the ancestors of quolls between 10 and 15 million years ago, when severe [climate change] climate change came to bear in Australia, transforming the climate from warm and moist to an arid, dry ice age, resulting in mass extinctions. As most of their prey died of the cold, only a few carnivores survived, including the ancestors of the [quoll] quoll and [thylacine] thylacine . It is speculated that the devil lineage may have arisen at this time to fill a niche in the ecosystem, as a scavenger that disposed of carrion left behind by the selective-eating thylacine. The extinct [Glaucodon] Glaucodon ballaratensis of the [Pliocene] Pliocene age has been dubbed an intermediate species between the quoll and devil. 
Fossil deposits in limestone caves at [Naracoorte, South Australia] Naracoorte, South Australia , dating to the [Miocene] Miocene include specimens of S. laniarius S. laniarius , which were around 15% larger and 50% heavier than modern devils. Older specimens believed to be 50–70,000 years old were found in [Darling Downs] Darling Downs in [Queensland] Queensland and in [Western Australia] Western Australia . It is not clear whether the modern devil evolved from S. laniarius S. laniarius , or whether they coexisted at the time. Richard Owen argued for the latter hypothesis in the 19th century, based on fossils found in 1877 in [New South Wales] New South Wales . Large bones attributed to S. moornaensis S. moornaensis have been found in New South Wales, and it has been conjectured that these two extinct larger species may have hunted and scavenged. It is known that there were several [genera] genera of thylacine millions of years ago, and that they ranged in size, the smaller being more reliant on foraging. As the devil and thylacine are similar, the extinction of the co-existing thylacine genera has been cited as evidence for an analogous history for the devils. It has been speculated that the smaller size of S. laniarius S. laniarius and S. moornaensis S. moornaensis allowed them to adapt to the changing conditions more effectively and survive longer than the corresponding thylacines. As the extinction of these two species came at a similar time to human habitation of Australia, hunting by humans and land clearance have been mooted as possible causes. Critics of this theory point out that as indigenous Australians only developed [boomerangs] boomerangs and spears for hunting around 10,000 years ago, a critical fall in numbers due to systematic hunting is unlikely. They also point out that caves inhabited by Aborigines have a low proportion of bones and rock paintings of devils, and suggest that this is an indication that it was not a large part of indigenous lifestyle. A scientific report in 1910 claimed that Aborigines preferred the meat of herbivores rather than carnivores. The other main theory for the extinction was that it was due to the climate change brought on by the most recent ice age. 
=== Genetics ===
The Tasmanian devil's [genome] genome was sequenced in 2010 by the [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute] Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute . Like all dasyurids, the devil has 14 chromosomes. Devils have a low [genetic diversity] genetic diversity compared to other Australian marsupials and placental carnivores; this is consistent with a [founder effect] founder effect as allelic size ranges were low and nearly continuous throughout all subpopulations measured. Allelic diversity was measured at 2.7–3.3 in the subpopulations sampled, and [heterozygosity] heterozygosity was in the range 0.386–0.467. According to a study by Menna Jones, "" [gene flow] gene flow appears extensive up to 50 km (31 mi)"", meaning a high assignment rate to source or close neighbour populations ""in agreement with movement data. At larger scales (150–250 km or 93–155 mi), gene flow is reduced but there is no evidence for isolation by distance"".  [Island effects] Island effects may also have contributed to their low genetic diversity. Periods of low population density may also have created moderate [population bottlenecks] population bottlenecks , reducing genetic diversity. Low genetic diversity is thought to have been a feature in the Tasmanian devil population since the mid- [Holocene] Holocene . Outbreaks of [devil facial tumour disease] devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) cause an increase in [inbreeding] inbreeding . A sub-population of devils in the north-west of the state is genetically distinct from other devils, but there is some exchange between the two groups. 
One strand conformation polymorphism analysis (OSCP) on the [major histocompatibility complex] major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [class I] class I domain taken from various locations across Tasmania showed 25 different types, and showed a different pattern of MHC types in north-western Tasmania to eastern Tasmania. Those devils in the east of the state have less MHC diversity; 30% are of the same type as the tumour (type 1), and 24% are of type A. Seven of every ten devils in the east are of type A, D, G or 1, which are linked to DFTD; whereas only 55% of the western devils fall into these MHC categories. Of the 25 MHC types, 40% are exclusive to the western devils. Although the north-west population is less genetically diverse overall, it has higher MHC gene diversity, which allows them to mount an immune response to DFTD. According to this research, mixing the devils may increase the chance of disease. Of the fifteen different regions in Tasmania surveyed in this research, six were in the eastern half of the island. In the eastern half, Epping Forest had only two different types, 75% being type O. In the Buckland-Nugent area, only three types were present, and there were an average of 5.33 different types per location. In contrast, in the west, Cape Sorell yielded three types, and Togari North-Christmas Hills yielded six, but the other seven sites all had at least eight MHC types, and West Pencil Pine had 15 types. There was an average of 10.11 MHC types per site in the west. Recent research has suggested that the wild population of devils are rapidly evolving a resistance to DFTD. 
== Description ==
The Tasmanian devil is the largest surviving carnivorous [marsupial] marsupial . It has a squat, thick build, with a large head and a tail which is about half its body length. Unusually for a marsupial, its forelegs are slightly longer than its hind legs, and devils can run up to 13 km/h (8.1 mph) for short distances. The fur is usually black, often with irregular white patches on the chest and rump (although approximately 16% of wild devils do not have white patches). These markings suggest that the devil is most active at dawn and dusk, and they are thought to draw biting attacks toward less important areas of the body, as fighting between devils often leads to a concentration of scars in that region. Males are usually larger than females, having an average head and body length of 652 mm (25.7 in), a 258 mm (10.2 in) tail and an average weight of 8 kg (18 lb). Females have an average head and body length of 570 mm (22 in), a 244 mm (9.6 in) tail and an average weight of 6 kg (13 lb), although devils in western Tasmania tend to be smaller. Devils have five long toes on their forefeet, four pointing to the front and one coming out from the side, which gives the devil the ability to hold food. The hind feet have four toes, and the devils have non-retractable claws. The stocky devils have a relatively low [centre of mass] centre of mass . 
Devils are fully grown at two years of age, and few devils live longer than five years in the wild. Possibly the longest-lived Tasmanian devil recorded was [Coolah] Coolah , a male devil which lived in captivity for more than seven years. Born in January 1997 at the [Cincinnati Zoo] Cincinnati Zoo , Coolah died in May 2004 at the [Fort Wayne Children's Zoo] Fort Wayne Children's Zoo . The devil stores body fat in its tail, and healthy devils have fat tails. The tail is largely non-prehensile and is important to its physiology, social behaviour and locomotion. It acts as a counterbalance to aid stability when the devil is moving quickly. An ano-genital scent gland at the base of its tail is used to mark the ground behind the animal with its strong, pungent scent. The male has external testes in a pouch-like structure formed by lateral ventrocrural folds of the abdomen, which partially hides and protects them. The testes are subovoid in shape and the mean dimensions of 30 testes of adult males was 3.17 cm × 2.57 cm (1.25 in × 1.01 in). The female's pouch opens backwards, and is present throughout its life, unlike some other dasyurids. 
The Tasmanian devil has the most powerful bite relative to body size of any living mammalian carnivore, with a [Bite Force Quotient] Bite Force Quotient of 181 and exerting a canine bite force of 553 N (124 lb f f ). The jaw can open to 75–80 degrees, allowing the devil to generate the large amount of power to tear meat and crush bones —sufficient force to allow it to bite through thick metal wire. The power of the [jaws] jaws is in part due to its comparatively large head. The teeth and jaws of Tasmanian devils resemble those of [hyenas] hyenas , an example of [convergent evolution] convergent evolution . Dasyurid teeth resemble those of primitive marsupials. Like all dasyurids, the devil has prominent canines and cheek teeth. It has three pairs of lower incisors and four pairs of upper incisors. These are located at the top of the front of the devil's mouth. Like dogs, it has 42 teeth, however, unlike dogs, its teeth are not replaced after birth but grow continuously throughout life at a slow rate. It has a ""highly carnivorous [dentition] dentition and [trophic] trophic adaptations for bone consumption"". The devil has long claws that allow it to dig burrows and seek subterranean food easily and grip prey or mates strongly. The teeth and claw strength allow the devil to attack wombats up to 30 kg (66 lb) in weight. The large neck and forebody that give the devil its strength also cause this strength to be biased towards the front half of the body; the lopsided, awkward, shuffling gait of the devil is attributed to this. 
The devil has long [whiskers] whiskers on its face and in clumps on the top of the head. These help the devil locate prey when foraging in the dark, and aid in detecting when other devils are close during feeding. The whiskers can extend from the tip of the chin to the rear of the jaw and can cover the span of its shoulder. Hearing is its dominant sense, and it also has an excellent sense of smell, which has a range of 1 km (0.62 mi). The devil, unlike other marsupials, has a ""well-defined, saddle-shaped [ectotympanic] ectotympanic "". Since devils hunt at night, their vision seems to be strongest in [black and white] black and white . In these conditions they can detect moving objects readily, but have difficulty seeing stationary objects. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Tasmanian devil was formerly present across mainland Australia, but became extinct there 3,500 years ago, co-incident with the extinction of the Thylacine from the region. A number of causal factors for the extinction have been proposed, including the introduction of the [dingo] dingo , intensification of human activity, as well as climatic change. 
Devils are found in all habitats on the island of Tasmania, including the outskirts of urban areas, and are distributed throughout the Tasmanian mainland and on [Robbins Island] Robbins Island (which is connected to mainland Tasmania at [low tide] low tide ). The north-western population is located west of the [Forth River] Forth River and as far south as [Macquarie Heads] Macquarie Heads . Previously, they were present on [Bruny Island] Bruny Island from the 19th century, but there have been no records of them after 1900. They were illegally introduced to [Badger Island] Badger Island in the mid-1990s but were removed by the Tasmanian government by 2007. Although the Badger Island population was free from DFTD, the removed individuals were returned to the Tasmanian mainland, some to infected areas. A study has modelled the reintroduction of DFTD-free Tasmanian devils to the Australian mainland in areas where [dingoes] dingoes are sparse. It is proposed that devils would have fewer impacts on both livestock and native fauna than dingoes, and that the mainland population could act as an additional [insurance population] insurance population . In September 2015, 20 immunised captive-bred devils were released into [Narawntapu National Park] Narawntapu National Park , Tasmania. Two later died from being hit by cars. 
The ""core habitat"" of the devils is considered to be within the "" [low to moderate annual rainfall zone] low to moderate annual rainfall zone of eastern and north-western Tasmania"". Tasmanian devils particularly like dry [sclerophyll] sclerophyll forests and coastal woodlands. Although they are not found at the highest altitudes of Tasmania, and their [population density] population density is low in the [button grass] button grass plains in the [south-west of the state] south-west of the state , their population is high in dry or mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heaths. Devils prefer open forest to tall forest, and dry rather than wet forests. They are also found near roads where roadkill is prevalent, although the devils themselves are often killed by vehicles while retrieving the carrion. According to the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, their versatility means that habitat modification from destruction is not seen as a major threat to the species. 
The devil is directly linked to the Dasyurotaenia robusta [Dasyurotaenia robusta] Dasyurotaenia robusta , a [tapeworm] tapeworm which is classified as Rare under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. This tapeworm is found only in devils. 
In late 2020, Tasmanian devils were reintroduced to mainland Australia in a sanctuary run by [Aussie Ark] Aussie Ark in the [Barrington Tops] Barrington Tops area of [New South Wales] New South Wales . This was the first time devils had lived on the Australian mainland in over 3,000 years. 26 adult devils were released into the 400 ha (990 acres) [protected area] protected area , and by late April 2021, seven [joeys] joeys had been born, with up to 20 expected by the end of the year. 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
The Tasmanian devil is a [keystone species] keystone species in the ecosystem of Tasmania. It is a [nocturnal] nocturnal and [crepuscular] crepuscular hunter, spending the days in dense bush or in a hole. It has been speculated that nocturnalism may have been adopted to avoid predation by eagles and humans. Young devils are predominantly crepuscular. There is no evidence of [torpor] torpor . 
Young devils can climb trees, but this becomes more difficult as they grow larger. Devils can scale trees of trunk diameter larger than 40 cm (16 in), which tend to have no small side branches to hang onto, up to a height of around 2.5–3 m (8 ft 2 in – 9 ft 10 in). Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a height of 4 m (13 ft), and can climb a tree to 7 m (23 ft) if it is not vertical. Adult devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape. Devils can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are 50 m (160 ft) in width, including icy cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically. 
Tasmanian devils do not form packs, but rather spend most of their time alone once weaned. Classically considered as [solitary animals] solitary animals , their social interactions were poorly understood. However, a [field study] field study published in 2009 shed some light on this. Tasmanian devils in [Narawntapu National Park] Narawntapu National Park were fitted with proximity sensing [radio collars] radio collars which recorded their interactions with other devils over several months from February to June 2006. This revealed that all devils were part of a single huge contact network, characterised by male-female interactions during mating season, while female–female interactions were the most common at other times, although frequency and patterns of contact did not vary markedly between seasons. Previously thought to fight over food, males only rarely interacted with other males. Hence, all devils in a region are part of a single social network. They are considered to be [non-territorial] non-territorial in general, but females are territorial around their dens. This allows a higher total mass of devils to occupy a given area than territorial animals, without conflict. Tasmanian devils instead occupy a [home range] home range . In a period of between two and four weeks, devils' home ranges are estimated to vary between 4 and 27 km (1.5 and 10.4 sq mi), with an average of 13 km (5.0 sq mi). The location and geometry of these areas depend on the distribution of food, particularly [wallabies] wallabies and [pademelons] pademelons nearby. 
Devils use three or four dens regularly. Dens formerly owned by [wombats] wombats are especially prized as maternity dens because of their security. Dense vegetation near creeks, thick grass tussocks, and caves are also used as dens. Adult devils use the same dens for life. It is believed that, as a secure den is highly prized, some may have been used for several centuries by generations of animals. Studies have suggested that food security is less important than den security, as [habitat destruction] habitat destruction that affects the latter has had more effect on mortality rates. Young pups remain in one den with their mother, and other devils are mobile, changing dens every 1–3 days and travelling a [mean] mean distance of 8.6 km (5.3 mi) every night. However, there are also reports that an upper bound can be 50 km (31 mi) per night. They choose to travel through lowlands, saddles and along the banks of creeks, particularly preferring carved-out tracks and livestock paths and eschewing steep slopes and rocky terrain. The amount of movement is believed to be similar throughout the year, except for mothers who have given birth recently. The similarity in travel distances for males and females is unusual for sexually dimorphic, solitary carnivores. As a male needs more food, he will spend more time eating than travelling. Devils typically make circuits of their home range during their hunts. In areas near human habitation, they are known to steal clothes, blankets and pillows and take them for use in dens in wooden buildings. 
While the [dasyurids] dasyurids have similar diet and anatomy, differing body sizes affect [thermoregulation] thermoregulation and thus behaviour. In ambient temperatures between 5 and 30 °C (41 and 86 °F), the devil was able to maintain a body temperature between 37.4 and 38 °C (99.3 and 100.4 °F). When the temperature was raised to 40 °C (104 °F), and the humidity to 50%, the devil's body temperature spiked upwards by 2 °C (3.6 °F) within 60 minutes, but then steadily decreased back to the starting temperature after a further two hours, and remained there for two more hours. During this time, the devil drank water and showed no visible signs of discomfort, leading scientists to believe that sweating and evaporative cooling is its primary means of heat dissipation. A later study found that devils pant but do not sweat to release heat. In contrast, many other marsupials were unable to keep their body temperatures down. As the smaller animals have to live in hotter and more arid conditions to which they are less well-adapted, they take up a nocturnal lifestyle and drop their body temperatures during the day, whereas the devil is active in the day and its body temperature varies by 1.8 °C (3.2 °F) from its minimum at night to the maximum in the middle of the day. 
The standard [metabolic rate] metabolic rate of a Tasmanian devil is 141 kJ/kg (15.3 [kcal] kcal /lb) per day, many times lower than smaller marsupials. A 5 kg (11 lb) devil uses 712 kJ (170,000 cal) per day. The field metabolic rate is 407 kJ/kg (44.1 kcal/lb). Along with quolls, Tasmanian devils have a metabolic rate comparable to non-carnivorous marsupials of a similar size. This differs from placental carnivores, which have comparatively high basal metabolic rates. A study of devils showed a loss of weight from 7.9 to 7.1 kg (17 to 16 lb) from summer to winter, but in the same time, daily energy consumption increased from 2,591 to 2,890 kJ (619,000 to 691,000 cal). This is equivalent to an increase in food consumption from 518 to 578 g (18.3 to 20.4 oz). The diet is protein-based with 70% water content. For every 1 g (0.035 oz) of insects consumed, 3.5 kJ (840 cal) of energy are produced, while a corresponding amount of wallaby meat generated 5.0 kJ (1,200 cal). In terms of its body mass, the devil eats only a quarter of the [eastern quoll] eastern quoll 's intake, allowing it to survive longer during food shortages.
=== Feeding ===
Tasmanian devils can take prey up to the size of a small [kangaroo] kangaroo , but in practice they are opportunistic and eat [carrion] carrion more often than they hunt live prey. Although the devil favours [wombats] wombats because of the ease of predation and high fat content, it will eat all small native mammals such as [wallabies] wallabies ,  [bettong] bettong and [potoroos] potoroos , domestic mammals (including sheep and rabbits), birds (including [penguins] penguins ), fish, fruit, vegetable matter, insects, tadpoles, frogs and reptiles. Their diet is widely varied and depends on the food available. Before the extinction of the [thylacine] thylacine , the Tasmanian devil ate thylacine joeys left alone in dens when their parents were away. This may have helped to hasten the extinction of the thylacine, which also ate devils. They are known to hunt water rats by the sea and forage on dead fish that have been washed ashore. Near human habitation, they can also steal shoes and chew on them, and eat the legs of otherwise robust sheep that have slipped in wooden shearing sheds, leaving their legs dangling below. Other unusual matter observed in devil scats includes collars and tags of devoured animals, intact echidna spines, pencil, plastic and jeans. Devils can bite through metal traps, and tend to reserve their strong jaws for escaping captivity rather than breaking into food storage. Due to their relative lack of speed, they cannot run down a wallaby or a rabbit, but they can attack animals that have become slow due to illness. They survey flocks of sheep by sniffing them from 10–15 m (33–49 ft) away and attack if the prey is ill. The sheep stamp their feet in a show of strength. 
Despite their lack of extreme speed, there have been reports that devils can run at 25 km/h (16 mph) for 1.5 km (0.93 mi), and it has been conjectured that, before European immigration and the introduction of livestock, vehicles and [roadkill] roadkill , they would have had to chase other native animals at a reasonable pace to find food. Pemberton has reported that they can average 10 km/h (6.2 mph) for ""extended periods"" on several nights per week, and that they run for long distances before sitting still for up to half an hour, something that has been interpreted as evidence of ambush predation. 
Devils can dig to forage [corpses] corpses , in one case digging down to eat the corpse of a buried horse that had died due to illness. They are known to eat animal cadavers by first ripping out the [digestive system] digestive system , which is the softest part of the anatomy, and they often reside in the resulting cavity while they are eating. 
On average, devils eat about 15% of their body weight each day, although they can eat up to 40% of their body weight in 30 minutes if the opportunity arises. This means they can become very heavy and lethargic after a large meal; in this state they tend to waddle away slowly and lie down, becoming easy to approach. This has led to a belief that such eating habits became possible due to the lack of a predator to attack such bloated individuals. 
Tasmanian devils can eliminate all traces of a carcass of a smaller animal, devouring the bones and fur if desired. In this respect, devils have earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, as the speed at which they clean a carcass helps prevent the spread of insects that might otherwise harm livestock. Some of these dead animals are disposed of when the devils haul off the excess feed back to their residence to continue eating at a later time. 
The diet of a devil can vary substantially for males and females, and seasonally, according to studies at Cradle Mountain. In winter, males prefer medium mammals over larger ones, with a ratio of 4:5, but in summer, they prefer larger prey in a 7:2 ratio. These two categories accounted for more than 95% of the diet. Females are less inclined to target large prey, but have the same seasonal bias. In winter, large and medium mammals account for 25% and 58% each, with 7% small mammals and 10% birds. In summer, the first two categories account for 61% and 37% respectively. 
Juvenile devils are sometimes known to climb trees; in addition to small vertebrates and invertebrates, juveniles climb trees to eat grubs and birds' eggs. Juveniles have also been observed climbing into nests and capturing birds. Throughout the year, adult devils derive 16.2% of their biomass intake from [arboreal] arboreal species, almost all of which is possum meat, just 1.0% being large birds. From February to July, subadult devils derive 35.8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12.2% being small birds and 23.2% being possums. Female devils in winter source 40.0% of their intake from arboreal species, including 26.7% from possums and 8.9% from various birds. Not all of these animals were caught while they were in trees, but this high figure for females, which is higher than for male spotted-tailed quolls during the same season, is unusual, as the devil has inferior tree climbing skills. 
Although they hunt alone, there have been unsubstantiated claims of communal hunting, where one devil drives prey out of its habitat and an accomplice attacks. Eating is a social event for the Tasmanian devil. This combination of a solitary animal that eats communally makes the devil unique among carnivores. Much of the noise attributed to the animal is a result of raucous communal eating, at which up to 12 individuals can gather, although groups of two to five are common; it can often be heard several kilometres away. This has been interpreted as notifications to colleagues to share in the meal, so that food is not wasted by rot and energy is saved. The amount of noise is correlated to the size of the carcass. The devils eat in accordance with a system. Juveniles are active at dusk, so they tend to reach the source before the adults. Typically, the [dominant] dominant animal eats until it is satiated and leaves, fighting off any challengers in the meantime. Defeated animals run into the bush with their hair and tail erect, their conqueror in pursuit and biting their victim's rear where possible. Disputes are less common as the food source increases as the motive appears to be getting sufficient food rather than oppressing other devils. When [quolls] quolls are eating a carcass, devils will tend to chase them away. This is a substantial problem for [spotted-tailed quolls] spotted-tailed quolls , as they kill relatively large possums and cannot finish their meal before devils arrive. In contrast, the smaller [eastern quolls] eastern quolls prey on much smaller victims, and can complete feeding before devils turn up. This is seen as a possible reason for the relatively small population of spotted-tailed quolls. 
A study of feeding devils identified twenty physical postures, including their characteristic vicious yawn, and eleven different vocal sounds, including clicks, shrieks and various types of [growls] growls , that devils use to communicate as they feed. They usually establish dominance by sound and physical posturing, although fighting does occur. The white patches on the devil are visible to the night-vision of its colleagues. Chemical gestures are also used. Adult males are the most aggressive, and scarring is common. They can also stand on their hind legs and push each other's shoulders with their front legs and heads, similar to [sumo wrestling] sumo wrestling . Torn flesh around the mouth and teeth, as well as punctures in the rump, can sometimes be observed, although these can also be inflicted during breeding fights. 
Digestion is very fast in dasyurids and, for the Tasmanian devil, the few hours taken for food to pass through the small gut is a long period in comparison to some other dasyuridae. Devils are known to return to the same places to defecate, and to do so at a communal location, called a devil latrine devil latrine . It is believed that the communal defecation may be a means of communication that is not well understood. Devil scats are very large compared to body size; they are on average 15 cm (5.9 in) long, but there have been samples that are 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. They are characteristically grey in colour due to digested bones, or have bone fragments included. 
Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between Tasmanian devils and thylacines was ""close and complex"", as they competed directly for prey and probably also for shelter. The thylacines preyed on the devils, the devils scavenged from the thylacine's kills, and the devils ate thylacine young. Menna Jones hypothesises that the two species shared the role of [apex predator] apex predator in Tasmania.  [Wedge-tailed eagles] Wedge-tailed eagles have a similar carrion-based diet to the devils and are regarded as competitors. Quolls and devils are also seen as being in direct competition in Tasmania. Jones believed that the quoll has evolved into its current state in just 100–200 generations of around two years as determined by the equal spacing effect on the devil, the largest species, the spotted-tail quoll, and the smallest species, the eastern quoll. Both the Tasmanian devil and the quolls appears to have evolved up to 50 times faster than the average evolutionary rate amongst mammals. 
=== Reproduction ===
Females start to breed when they reach sexual maturity, typically in their second year. At this point, they become [fertile] fertile once a year, producing multiple [ova] ova while in heat. As prey is most abundant in spring and early summer, the devil's reproductive cycle starts in March or April so that the end of the weaning period coincides with the maximisation of food supplies in the wild for the newly roaming young devils. 
Occurring in March, mating takes places in sheltered locations during both day and night. Males fight over females in the breeding season, and female devils will [mate] mate with the dominant male. Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and copulation can take five days; one instance of a couple being in the mating den for eight days has been recorded. Devils are not [monogamous] monogamous , and females will mate with several males if not guarded after mating; males also reproduce with several females during a season. Females have been shown to be selective in an attempt to ensure the best genetic offspring, for example, fighting off the advances of smaller males. Males often keep their mates in custody in the den, or take them along if they need to drink, lest they engage in infidelity. 
Males can produce up to 16 offspring over their lifetime, while females average four mating seasons and 12 offspring. Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and make the species insulated against high mortality. The pregnancy rate is high; 80% of two-year-old females were observed with newborns in their pouches during the mating season. More recent studies of breeding place the mating season between February and June, as opposed to between February and March. 
[Gestation] Gestation lasts 21 days, and devils give birth to 20–30 young standing up, each weighing approximately 0.18–0.24 g (0.0063–0.0085 oz).  [Embryonic diapause] Embryonic diapause does not occur. At birth, the front limb has well-developed digits with claws; unlike many marsupials, the claws of baby devils are not [deciduous] deciduous . As with most other marsupials, the forelimb is longer (0.26–0.43 cm or 0.10–0.17 in) than the rear limb (0.20–0.28 cm or 0.079–0.110 in), the eyes are spots, and the body is pink. There are no external ears or openings. Unusually, the sex can be determined at birth, with an external scrotum present. 
Tasmanian devil young are variously called ""pups"", ""joeys"", or ""imps"". When the young are born, competition is fierce as they move from the vagina in a sticky flow of mucus to the pouch. Once inside the pouch, they each remain attached to a nipple for the next 100 days. The female Tasmanian devil's pouch, like that of the [wombat] wombat , opens to the rear, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with young inside the pouch. Despite the large litter at birth, the female has only four nipples, so there are never more than four babies nursing in the pouch, and the older a female devil gets, the smaller her litters will become. Once the young have made contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the oversized nipple being firmly clamped inside the newborn and ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the pouch. On average, more females survive than males, and up to 60% of young do not survive to maturity. Milk replacements are often used for devils that have been bred in captivity, for orphaned devils or young who are born to diseased mothers. Little is known about the composition of the devil's milk compared to other marsupials. 
Inside the pouch, the nourished young develop quickly. In the second week, the [rhinarium] rhinarium becomes distinctive and heavily pigmented. At 15 days, the [external parts of the ear] external parts of the ear are visible, although these are attached to the head and do not open out until the devil is around 10 weeks old. The ear begins blackening after around 40 days, when it is less than 1 cm (0.39 in) long, and by the time the ear becomes erect, it is between 1.2 and 1.6 cm (0.47 and 0.63 in). Eyelids are apparent at 16 days, whiskers at 17 days, and the lips at 20 days. The devils can make squeaking noises after eight weeks, and after around 10–11 weeks, the lips can open. Despite the formation of eyelids, they do not open for three months, although eyelashes form at around 50 days. The young—up to this point they are pink—start to grow fur at 49 days and have a full coat by 90 days. The fur growing process starts at the snout and proceeds back through the body, although the tail attains fur before the rump, which is the last part of the body to become covered. Just before the start of the furring process, the colour of the bare devil's skin will darken and become black or dark grey in the tail. 
The devils have a complete set of facial [vibrissae] vibrissae and ulnar carpels, although it is devoid of [anconeal] anconeal vibrissae. During the third week, the [mystacials] mystacials and ulnarcarpals are the first to form. Subsequently, the [infraorbital] infraorbital , interramal, [supraorbital] supraorbital and submental vibrissae form. The last four typically occur between the 26th and 39th day. Their eyes open shortly after their fur coat develops—between 87 and 93 days—and their mouths can relax their hold of the nipple at 100 days. They leave the pouch 105 days after birth, appearing as small copies of the parent and weighing around 200 g (7.1 oz). Zoologist Eric Guiler recorded its size at this time as follows: a [crown-snout length] crown-snout length of 5.87 cm (2.31 in), tail length of 5.78 cm (2.28 in), [pes] pes length 2.94 cm (1.16 in), [manus] manus 2.30 cm (0.91 in), shank 4.16 cm (1.64 in), forearm 4.34 cm (1.71 in) and [crown-rump length] crown-rump length is 11.9 cm (4.7 in). During this period, the devils lengthen at a roughly linear rate. 
After being ejected, the devils stay outside the pouch, but they remain in the den for around another three months, first venturing outside the den between October and December before becoming independent in January. During this transitional phase out of the pouch, the young devils are relatively safe from predation as they are generally accompanied. When the mother is hunting they can stay inside a shelter or come along, often riding on their mother's back. During this time they continue to drink their mother's milk. Female devils are occupied with raising their young for all but approximately six weeks of the year. The milk contains a higher amount of iron than the milk of placental mammals. In Guiler's 1970 study, no females died while rearing their offspring in the pouch. After leaving the pouch, the devils grow by around 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) a month until they are six months old. While most pups will survive to be weaned, Guiler reported that up to three fifths of devils do not reach maturity. As juveniles are more crepuscular than adults, their appearance in the open during summer gives the impression to humans of a population boom. A study into the success of translocated devils that were orphaned and raised in captivity found that young devils who had consistently engaged with new experiences while they were in captivity survived better than young who had not. 
== Conservation status ==
The cause of the devil's disappearance from the mainland is unclear, but their decline seems to coincide with an abrupt change in climate and the expansion across the mainland of [indigenous Australians] indigenous Australians and [dingoes] dingoes . However, whether it was direct hunting by people, competition with dingoes, changes brought about by the increasing human population, who by 3000 years ago were using all habitat types across the continent, or a combination of all three, is unknown; devils had coexisted with dingoes on the mainland for around 3000 years. Brown has also proposed that the [El Niño–Southern Oscillation] El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) grew stronger during the Holocene, and that the devil, as a scavenger with a short life span, was highly sensitive to this. In dingo-free Tasmania, carnivorous marsupials were still active when Europeans arrived. The extermination of the [thylacine] thylacine after the arrival of the Europeans is well known, but the Tasmanian devil was threatened as well. 
Habitat disruption can expose dens where mothers raise their young. This increases mortality, as the mother leaves the disturbed den with her pups clinging to her back, making them more vulnerable. Cancer in general is a common cause of death in devils. In 2008, high levels of potentially [carcinogenic] carcinogenic flame retardant chemicals were found in Tasmanian devils. Preliminary results of tests ordered by the Tasmanian government on chemicals found in fat tissue from 16 devils have revealed high levels of [hexabromobiphenyl] hexabromobiphenyl (BB153) and ""reasonably high"" levels of [decabromodiphenyl ether] decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209). The Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal is the official fundraising entity for the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The priority is to ensure the survival of the Tasmanian devil in the wild.
=== Population declines ===
At least two major population declines, possibly due to disease epidemics, have occurred in recorded history: in 1909 and 1950. The devil was also reported as scarce in the 1850s. It is difficult to estimate the size of the devil population. In the mid-1990s, the population was estimated at 130,000–150,000 animals, but this is likely to have been an overestimate. The Tasmanian devil's population has been calculated in 2008 by Tasmania's [Department of Primary Industries and Water] Department of Primary Industries and Water as being in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 individuals, with 20,000 to 50,000 mature individuals being likely. Experts estimate that the devil has suffered a more than 80% decline in its population since the mid-1990s and that only around 10,000–15,000 remain in the wild as of 2008. 
The species was listed as vulnerable under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 [Threatened Species Protection Act 1995] Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 in 2005 and the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999] Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in 2006, which means that it is at risk of extinction in the ""medium term"". The [IUCN] IUCN classified the Tasmanian devil in the lower risk/least concern category in 1996, but in 2009 they reclassified it as endangered. Appropriate wildlife refuges such as [Savage River National Park] Savage River National Park in North West Tasmania provide hope for their survival.
=== Culling ===
The first European Tasmanian settlers ate Tasmanian devil, which they described as tasting like [veal] veal . As it was believed devils would hunt and kill livestock, possibly due to strong imagery of packs of devils eating weak sheep, a bounty scheme to remove the devil from rural properties was introduced as early as 1830. However, Guiler's research contended that the real cause of livestock losses was poor land management policies and feral dogs. In areas where the devil is now absent, poultry has continued to be killed by [quolls] quolls . In earlier times, hunting possums and wallabies for fur was a big business—more than 900,000 animals were hunted in 1923—and this resulted in a continuation of bounty hunting of devils as they were thought to be a major threat to the fur industry, even though quolls were more adept at hunting the animals in question. Over the next 100 years, trapping and poisoning brought them to the brink of extinction. 
After the death of the last thylacine in 1936, the Tasmanian devil was protected by law in June 1941 and the population slowly recovered. In the 1950s, with reports of increasing numbers, some permits to capture devils were granted after complaints of livestock damage. In 1966, poisoning permits were issued although attempts to have the animal unprotected failed. During this time environmentalists also became more outspoken, particularly as scientific studies provided new data suggesting the threat of devils to livestock had been vastly exaggerated. Numbers may have peaked in the early 1970s after a population boom; in 1975 they were reported to be lower, possibly due to overpopulation and consequent lack of food. Another report of overpopulation and livestock damage was reported in 1987. The following year, Trichinella spiralis [Trichinella spiralis] Trichinella spiralis , a parasite which kills animals and can infect humans, was found in devils and minor panic broke out before scientists assured the public that 30% of devils had it but that they could not transmit it to other species. Control permits were ended in the 1990s, but illegal killing continues to a limited extent, albeit ""locally intense"". This is not considered a substantial problem for the survival of the devil. Approximately 10,000 devils were killed per year in the mid-1990s. A selective culling program has taken place to remove individuals affected with DFTD, and has been shown to not slow the rate of disease progression or reduced the number of animals dying. A model has been tested to find out whether culling devils infected with DFTD would assist in the survival of the species, and it has found that culling would not be a suitable strategy to employ. 
=== Road mortality ===
Motor vehicles are a threat to localised populations of non-abundant Tasmanian mammals, and a 2010 study showed that devils were particularly vulnerable. A study of nine species, mostly marsupials of a similar size, showed that devils were more difficult for drivers to detect and avoid. At high beam, devils had the lowest detection distance, 40% closer than the median. This requires a 20% reduction in speed for a motorist to avoid the devil. For low beam, the devils had the second shortest detection distance, 16% below the median. For avoidance of roadkill to be feasible, motorists would have to drive at around half the current speed limit in rural areas. A study in the 1990s on a localised population of devils in a national park in Tasmania recorded a halving of the population after a hitherto gravel access road was upgraded, surfaced with bitumen and widened. At the same time, there was a large increase in deaths caused by vehicles along the new road; there had been none in the preceding six months. 
The vast majority of deaths occurred in the sealed portion of the road, believed to be due to an increase in speeds. It was also conjectured that the animals were harder to see against the dark bitumen instead of the light gravel. The devil and quoll are especially vulnerable as they often try to retrieve roadkill for food and travel along the road. To alleviate the problem, traffic slowing measures, man-made pathways that offer alternative routes for devils, education campaigns, and the installation of light reflectors to indicate oncoming vehicles have been implemented. They are credited with decreases in roadkill. Devils have often been victims of roadkill when they are retrieving other roadkill. Work by scientist Menna Jones and a group of conservation volunteers to remove dead animals from the road resulted in a significant reduction in devil traffic deaths. It was estimated that 3,392 devils, or 3.8–5.7% of the population, were being killed annually by vehicles in 2001–2004. In 2009, the Save the Tasmanian Devil group launched the ""Roadkill Project"", which allowed members of the public to report sightings of devils which had been killed on the road. On 25 September 2015, 20 immunised devils were microchipped and released in Narawntapu National Park. By 5 October four had been hit by cars, prompting Samantha Fox, leader of Save the Tasmanian Devil, to describe roadkill as being the biggest threat to the Tasmanian devil after DFTD. A series of solar-powered alarms have been trialled that make noises and flash lights when cars are approaching, warning the animals. The trial ran for 18 months and the trial area had two-thirds less deaths than the control. 
=== Devil facial tumour disease ===
First seen in 1996 in Mount William in northeastern Tasmania, [devil facial tumour disease] devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has ravaged Tasmania's wild devils, and estimates of the impact range from 20% to as much as an 80% decline in the devil population, with over 65% of the state affected. The state's west coast area and far north-west are the only places where devils are tumour free. Individual devils die within months of infection. The disease is an example of [transmissible cancer] transmissible cancer , which means that it is contagious and passed from one animal to another. This tumour is able to pass between hosts without inducing a response from the host's immune system. Dominant devils who engage in more biting behaviour are more exposed to the disease. 
Wild Tasmanian devil populations are being monitored to track the spread of the disease and to identify changes in disease prevalence. Field monitoring involves trapping devils within a defined area to check for the presence of the disease and determine the number of affected animals. The same area is visited repeatedly to characterise the spread of the disease over time. So far, it has been established that the short-term effects of the disease in an area can be severe. Long-term monitoring at replicated sites will be essential to assess whether these effects remain, or whether populations can recover. Field workers are also testing the effectiveness of disease suppression by trapping and removing diseased devils. It is hoped that the removal of diseased devils from wild populations should decrease disease prevalence and allow more devils to survive beyond their juvenile years and breed. In March 2017, scientists at the University of Tasmania presented an apparent first report of having successfully treated Tasmanian devils with the disease. Live cancer cells that were treated with [IFN-γ] IFN-γ to restore [MHC-I] MHC-I expression, were injected into the infected devils to stimulate their immune system to recognise and fight the disease. In 2020 it was reported that one of the last DFTD-free wild population of Tasmanian devils was suffering from inbreeding depression and has undergone a significant decline in reproductive success in recent years. 
== Relationship with humans ==
At [Lake Nitchie] Lake Nitchie in western [New South Wales] New South Wales in 1970, a male human skeleton wearing a necklace of 178 teeth from 49 different devils was found. The skeleton is estimated to be 7000 years old, and the necklace is believed to be much older than the skeleton. Archaeologist [Josephine Flood] Josephine Flood believes the devil was hunted for its teeth and that this contributed to its extinction on mainland Australia. Owen and Pemberton note that few such necklaces have been found.  [Middens] Middens that contain devil bones are rare—two notable examples are [Devil's Lair] Devil's Lair in the south-western part of Western Australia and [Tower Hill] Tower Hill in Victoria. In Tasmania, [local Indigenous Australians] local Indigenous Australians and devils sheltered in the same caves. Tasmanian Aboriginal names for the devil recorded by Europeans include ""tarrabah"", ""poirinnah"", and ""par-loo-mer-rer"". Variations also exist, such as ""Taraba"" and ""purinina"". 
It is a common belief that devils will eat humans. While they are known to eat dead bodies, there are prevalent myths that they eat living humans who wander into the bush. Despite outdated beliefs and exaggerations regarding their disposition, many, although not all, devils will remain still when in the presence of a human; some will also shake nervously. They can bite and scratch out of fear when held by a human, but a firm grip will cause them to remain still. Although they can be tamed, they are asocial, and are not considered appropriate as pets; they have an unpleasant odour, and neither demonstrate nor respond to affection. 
Until recently, the devil was not studied much by academics and naturalists. At the start of the 20th century, Hobart zoo operator Mary Roberts, who was not a trained scientist, was credited for changing people's attitudes and encouraging scientific interest in native animals (such as the devil) that were seen as fearsome and abhorrent, and the human perception of the animal changed.  [Theodore Thomson Flynn] Theodore Thomson Flynn was the first professor of biology in Tasmania, and carried out some research during the period around World War I. In the mid-1960s, Professor Guiler assembled a team of researchers and started a decade of systematic fieldwork on the devil. This is seen as the start of modern scientific study of it. However, the devil was still negatively depicted, including in tourism material. The first doctorate awarded for research into the devil came in 1991. 
=== In captivity ===
Early attempts to breed Tasmanian devils in captivity had limited success. Mary Roberts bred a pair at [Beaumaris Zoo] Beaumaris Zoo (which she named Billy and Truganini) in 1913. However, although advised to remove Billy, Roberts found Truganini too distressed by his absence, and returned him. The first litter was presumed eaten by Billy, but a second litter in 1914 survived, after Billy was removed. Roberts wrote an article on keeping and breeding the devils for the [London Zoological Society] London Zoological Society . Even by 1934, successful breeding of the devil was rare. In a study on the growth of young devils in captivity, some developmental stages were very different from those reported by Guiler. The pinnae were free on day 36, and eyes opened later, on days 115–121. In general, females tend to retain more stress after being taken into captivity than males. 
Tasmanian devils were displayed in various zoos around the world from the 1850s onwards. In the 1950s several animals were given to European zoos. In October 2005 the Tasmanian government sent four devils, two male and two female, to the [Copenhagen Zoo] Copenhagen Zoo , following the birth of the [first son] first son of [King Frederik X of Denmark] King Frederik X of Denmark and his Tasmanian-born wife [Mary] Mary . Due to restrictions on their export by the Australian government, at the time these were the only devils known to be living outside Australia. In June 2013, due to the successes of the insurance population program, it was planned to send devils to other zoos around the world in a pilot program.  [San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance] San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and [Albuquerque Biopark] Albuquerque Biopark were selected to participate in the program, and [Wellington Zoo] Wellington Zoo and [Auckland Zoo] Auckland Zoo soon followed. In the United States, four additional zoos have since been selected as part of the Australian government's Save the Tasmanian Devil program, the zoos selected were: the [Fort Wayne Children's Zoo] Fort Wayne Children's Zoo , the [Los Angeles Zoo] Los Angeles Zoo , the [Saint Louis Zoo] Saint Louis Zoo , and the [Toledo Zoo] Toledo Zoo . Captive devils are usually forced to stay awake during the day to cater to visitors, rather than following their natural nocturnal style. 
=== In popular culture ===
The devil is an iconic animal within Australia, and particularly associated with Tasmania. The animal is used as the emblem of the [Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service] Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service , and the former Tasmanian Australian rules football team which played in the [Victorian Football League] Victorian Football League was known as the [Devils] Devils . The [Hobart Devils] Hobart Devils were once part of the [National Basketball League] National Basketball League . The devil has appeared on several [commemorative coins] commemorative coins in Australia over the years.  [Cascade Brewery] Cascade Brewery in Tasmania sells a [ginger beer] ginger beer with a Tasmanian devil on the label. In 2015, the Tasmanian devil was chosen as Tasmania's [state emblem] state emblem . 
Tasmanian devils are popular with tourists, and the director of the Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park has described their possible extinction as ""a really significant blow for Australian and Tasmanian tourism"". There has also been a multimillion-dollar proposal to build a giant 19 m-high, 35 m-long devil in [Launceston] Launceston in northern Tasmania as a tourist attraction. Devils began to be used as [ecotourism] ecotourism in the 1970s, when studies showed that the animals were often the only things known about Tasmania overseas, and suggested that they should therefore be the centrepiece of marketing efforts, resulting in some devils being taken on promotional tours. 
The Tasmanian devil is probably best known internationally as the inspiration for the Looney Tunes Looney Tunes cartoon character [the Tasmanian Devil] the Tasmanian Devil , or ""Taz"" in 1954. Little known at the time, the loud hyperactive cartoon character has little in common with the real life animal. After a few shorts between 1957 and 1964, the character was retired until the 1990s, when he gained his own show, Taz-Mania [Taz-Mania] Taz-Mania , and again became popular. In 1997, a newspaper report noted that [Warner Bros.] Warner Bros. had ""trademarked the character and registered the name Tasmanian Devil"", and that this trademark ""was policed"", including an eight-year legal case to allow a Tasmanian company to call a fishing lure ""Tasmanian Devil"". Debate followed, and a delegation from the Tasmanian government met with Warner Bros.  [Ray Groom] Ray Groom , the Tourism Minister, later announced that a ""verbal agreement"" had been reached. An annual fee would be paid to Warner Bros. in return for the Government of Tasmania being able to use the image of Taz for ""marketing purposes"". This agreement later disappeared. In 2006, Warner Bros. permitted the Government of Tasmania to sell stuffed toys of Taz with profits funnelled into research on DFTD.

Komodo Dragon,Komodo dragon,"
The Komodo dragon Komodo dragon ( Varanus komodoensis Varanus komodoensis Varanus komodoensis ), also known as the Komodo monitor Komodo monitor , is a large reptile of the [monitor lizard] monitor lizard family [Varanidae] Varanidae that is [endemic] endemic to the Indonesian islands of [Komodo] Komodo , [Rinca] Rinca , [Flores] Flores , Gili Dasami, and [Gili Motang] Gili Motang . It is the [largest extant species of lizard] largest extant species of lizard , with the males growing to a maximum length of 3 m (9.8 ft) and weighing up to 150 kg (330 lb).
As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are [apex predators] apex predators , and dominate the [ecosystems] ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including [invertebrates] invertebrates , birds, and [mammals] mammals . Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of [Javan rusa] Javan rusa ( Rusa timorensis Rusa timorensis ), though they also eat considerable amounts of [carrion] carrion . Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.
Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September; as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned [megapode] megapode nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such as [cannibalistic] cannibalistic adults, which young Komodo dragons also try to repel by rolling in feces. They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years.
Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has been reduced by human encroachment and is likely to contract further from the effects of [climate change] climate change ; hence, they are listed as [Endangered] Endangered by the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List . They are protected under [Indonesian law] Indonesian law , and [Komodo National Park] Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to aid protection efforts.
== Taxonomy ==
Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a ""land crocodile"" reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the [Dutch colonial] Dutch colonial administration. Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when [Peter Ouwens] Peter Ouwens , the director of the [Zoological Museum of Bogor] Zoological Museum of Bogor , [Java] Java , published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector. 
The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at [London Zoo] London Zoo when it opened in 1927.  [Joan Beauchamp Procter] Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated their behaviour at a scientific meeting of the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London in 1928. 
The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to [Komodo Island] Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning with 12 preserved specimens and two live ones, this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie [King Kong] King Kong King Kong . It was also Burden who coined the common name ""Komodo dragon"". Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the [American Museum of Natural History] American Museum of Natural History . 
The Dutch island administration, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, soon outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, [Walter Auffenberg] Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons. 
Research from the Auffenberg expedition proved enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity. Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures. 
=== Etymology ===
The Komodo dragon is also sometimes known as the Komodo monitor Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature, although these names are uncommon. To the natives of [Komodo Island] Komodo Island , it is referred to as ora ora , buaya darat buaya darat ('land crocodile'), or biawak raksasa biawak raksasa ('giant monitor'). 
=== Evolutionary history ===
Genetic analysis of [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA shows the Komodo dragon to be the closest relative ( [sister taxon] sister taxon ) of the Australian [lace monitor] lace monitor ( V. varius V. varius ), with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that gave rise to the crocodile monitor ( Varanus salvadorii [Varanus salvadorii] Varanus salvadorii ) of [New Guinea] New Guinea . A 2021 study showed that during the late [Miocene] Miocene , the ancestors of Komodo dragons had hybridized with the common ancestor of Australian sand monitors (including V. spenceri [V. spenceri] V. spenceri , [V. gouldii] V. gouldii V. gouldii , [V. rosenbergi] V. rosenbergi V. rosenbergi and [V. panoptes] V. panoptes V. panoptes ). 
Fossils from across [Queensland] Queensland demonstrate that the Komodo dragon was once present in Australia, with fossils spanning from the [Early Pliocene] Early Pliocene (~3.8 million years ago) to the [Middle Pleistocene] Middle Pleistocene , with the youngest confirmed records of the species in Australia dating to at latest 330,000 years ago. In Australia, it coexisted with the even larger monitor species Varanus priscus [Varanus priscus] Varanus priscus also known as megalania, the largest terrestrial lizard ever. The oldest records of the Komodo dragon on Flores date to around 1.4 million years ago, during the [Early Pleistocene] Early Pleistocene . Additionally, Pleistocene fossils of Varanus Varanus found in Java and Timor may belong to the Komodo dragon. 
== Description ==
In the wild, adult Komodo dragons usually weigh around 70 kg (150 lb), although captive specimens often weigh more. According to Guinness World Records [Guinness World Records] Guinness World Records , an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91 kg (174 to 201 lb) and measure 2.59 m (8.5 ft), while an average female will weigh 68 to 73 kg (150 to 161 lb) and measure 2.29 m (7.5 ft). The largest verified specimen in captivity was 3.13 m (10 ft 3 in) long and weighed 166 kg (366 lb), including its undigested food. The largest wild specimen had a length 3.04 m (10 ft), a [snout-vent length] snout-vent length (SVL) 1.54 m (5 ft 1 in) and a mass of 81.5 kg (180 lb) excluding stomach contents. The heaviest reached a mass of 87.4 kg (193 lb). The study noted that weights greater than 100 kg (220 lb) were possible but only after the animal had consumed a large meal. 
The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in length. Its [saliva] saliva is frequently blood-tinged because its teeth are almost completely covered by [gingival tissue] gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. It also has a long, yellow, deeply [forked tongue] forked tongue . Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called [osteoderms] osteoderms that function as a sort of natural [chain-mail] chain-mail . The only areas lacking osteoderms on the head of the adult Komodo dragon are around the eyes, nostrils, mouth margins, and [parietal eye] parietal eye , a light-sensing organ on the top of the head. Where lizards typically have one or two varying patterns or shapes of osteoderms, komodos have four: rosette, platy, dendritic, and vermiform. This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor source of leather. Additionally, these osteoderms become more extensive and variable in shape as the Komodo dragon ages, ossifying more extensively as the lizard grows. These osteoderms are absent in hatchlings and juveniles, indicating that the natural armor develops as a product of age and competition between adults for protection in intraspecific combat over food and mates. 
== Morphology ==
=== Dentition ===
Komodo dragons have ziphodont teeth, which are defined as teeth that are laterally flattened, recurved, and with serrated tooth crowns where the serrations have a [dentine] dentine core and a very thin [enamel] enamel outer layer. This is the same type of dentition observed in many extinct [theropod] theropod dinosaurs. The teeth of the [insectivorous] insectivorous juveniles in contrast are barely recurved, with fewer and less well-developed serrations that lack dentine cores. 
A 2024 study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution [Nature Ecology & Evolution] Nature Ecology & Evolution found that Komodo dragons have orange, [iron] iron -enriched coatings on their tooth serrations and tips, as an adaptation for maintaining the sharp cutting edges. This feature is also observed to a lesser degree in a few other [Australasian] Australasian to Asian monitor species, though notably absent in a few other species from that range. 
Teeth are quickly replaced every 40 days, while maintaining up to 5 replacement teeth for each tooth position at any given time. This high rate of replacement and large number of replacement teeth is similar to that of the [crocodile monitor] crocodile monitor . Many other monitor species as well as [Chinese crocodile lizards] Chinese crocodile lizards and [beaded lizards] beaded lizards only have 1-2 replacement teeth behind each tooth position. 
=== Senses ===
As with other varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone, the [stapes] stapes , for transferring vibrations from the [tympanic membrane] tympanic membrane to the [cochlea] cochlea . This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 [hertz] hertz range, compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz. They were formerly thought to be [deaf] deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or shouts. This was disputed when [London Zoo] London Zoo employee Joan Procter trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be seen. 
The Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as 300 m (980 ft), but because its retinas only contain [cones] cones , it is thought to have poor night vision. It can distinguish colours, but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects. 
As with many other reptiles, the Komodo dragon primarily relies on its tongue to detect, [taste] taste , and [smell] smell  [stimuli] stimuli , with the [vomeronasal] vomeronasal sense using the [Jacobson's organ] Jacobson's organ , rather than using the nostrils. With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from 4–9.5 km (2.5–5.9 mi) away. It only has a few [taste buds] taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have [sensory plaques] sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an [ectotherm] ectotherm , it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some [nocturnal] nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to 20 km/h (12 mph), diving up to 4.5 m (15 ft), and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws. To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support. As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical. 
For shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from 1 to 3 m (3.3 to 9.8 ft) wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws. Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after. The Komodo dragon stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day and hunts in the afternoon. These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer. 
=== Diet ===
Komodo dragons are [apex predators] apex predators . They are carnivores; although they have been considered as eating mostly carrion, they will frequently ambush live prey with a stealthy approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon's ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal at high speeds and go for the underside or the throat. 
Komodo dragons do not deliberately allow the prey to escape with fatal injuries but try to kill prey outright using a combination of lacerating damage and blood loss. They have been recorded as killing wild pigs within seconds, and observations of Komodo dragons tracking prey for long distances are likely misinterpreted cases of prey escaping an attack before succumbing to infection. Most prey attacked by a Komodo dragon reputedly suffer from said sepsis and will later be eaten by the same or other lizards. 
Komodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws, flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The undigested vegetable contents of a prey animal's stomach and intestines are typically avoided. Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (15–20 minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully that the tree is knocked down. A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while swallowing. 
After eating up to 80% of its body weight in one meal, it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested in its stomach for too long. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus. 
The eating habits of Komodo dragons follow a hierarchy, with the larger animals generally eating before the smaller ones. The largest male typically asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to ""wrestling"". Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors. 
The Komodo dragon's diet varies depending on stage of growth. Young Komodo dragons will eat insects, birds and bird's eggs and small reptiles, while larger Komodo dragons (typically over 20 kg (44 lb)) prefer large [ungulate] ungulate prey, such as [Javan rusa] Javan rusa deer, [wild pigs] wild pigs and [water buffalo] water buffalo . Occasionally, they attack and bite humans. Sometimes they consume human corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves. This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground, and pile rocks on top of them, to deter the lizards. Dwarf species of Stegodon [Stegodon] Stegodon (a proboscidean related to living elephants) are suggested to have been a primary prey item of the Komodo dragon during the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene , prior to the introduction of their modern ungulate prey, which were only introduced to the islands in the [Holocene] Holocene , around 10-7,000 years ago. 
The Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via [buccal pumping] buccal pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat. 
=== Saliva ===
Although previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey, research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of Komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores. Komodo dragons have good mouth hygiene. To quote Bryan Fry: ""After they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth ... Unlike people have been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria."" They do have a slashing bite, which normally includes a dose of their neurotoxin venom and anticoagulant saliva. Komodo dragons do not wait for prey to die and track it at a distance, as [vipers] vipers do; observations of them hunting deer, boar and in some cases buffalo reveal that they kill prey in less than half an hour. 
The observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of [water buffalos] water buffalos , who are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water after escaping an attack. The warm, faeces-filled water would then cause the infections. The study used samples from 16 captive dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three US zoos. 
=== Antibacterial immune factor ===
Researchers have isolated a powerful antibacterial [peptide] peptide from the [blood plasma] blood plasma of Komodo dragons, VK25. Based on their analysis of this peptide, they have synthesized a short peptide dubbed DRGN-1 and tested it against [multidrug-resistant (MDR)] multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Preliminary results of these tests show that DRGN-1 is effective in killing drug-resistant bacterial strains and even some fungi. It has the added observed benefit of significantly promoting wound healing in both uninfected and mixed [biofilm] biofilm infected wounds. 
=== Venom ===
In late 2005, researchers at the [University of Melbourne] University of Melbourne speculated the [perentie] perentie ( Varanus giganteus Varanus giganteus ), other species of monitors, and [agamids] agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation. Bites on human digits by a [lace monitor] lace monitor ( V. varius V. varius ), a Komodo dragon, and a [spotted tree monitor] spotted tree monitor ( V. timorensis V. timorensis ) all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours. 
In 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite. [MRI] MRI scans of a preserved [skull] skull showed the presence of two [glands] glands in the lower jaw. The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the [Singapore Zoological Gardens] Singapore Zoological Gardens , and found it secreted several different toxic [proteins] proteins . The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey. As a result of the discovery, the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was disputed. 
Other scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands ""has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution."" According to these scientists ""reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey."" These researchers concluded that, ""Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems."" Evolutionary biologist Schwenk says that even if the lizards have venom-like proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors. 
=== Reproduction ===
[Mating] Mating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in September. During this period, males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight. The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity. Females are [antagonistic] antagonistic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and licking. Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his [hemipenes] hemipenes into the female's [cloaca] cloaca . Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form ""pair bonds"", a rare behavior for lizards. 
Female Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality; in one study, 60% laid their eggs in the nests of [orange-footed scrubfowl] orange-footed scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or [megapode] megapode ), 20% on ground level and 20% in hilly areas. The females make many camouflage nests/holes to prevent other dragons from eating the eggs. Nests typically house one female, however a study found evidence of two females occasionally occupying the same den. Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period of 7–8 months. Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells with an [egg tooth] egg tooth that falls off before long. After cutting themselves out, the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation. Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46.5 cm long and weighed 105.1 grams. 
Young Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets. The habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands is rare. When the young approach a kill, they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults. Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to mature, and may live for up to 30 years. 
A Komodo dragon at [London Zoo] London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store [sperm] sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an [adaptation] adaptation known as [superfecundation] superfecundation . On 20 December 2006, it was reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the [Chester Zoo] Chester Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilised eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched, all of them male. Scientists at [Liverpool University] Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon. After Flora's eggs' condition had been discovered, testing showed Sungai's eggs were also produced without outside fertilization. On 31 January 2008, the [Sedgwick County Zoo] Sedgwick County Zoo in [Wichita, Kansas] Wichita, Kansas , became the first zoo in the Americas to document [parthenogenesis] parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons. The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons, one of which laid about 17 eggs on 19–20 May 2007. Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space issues; the first hatched on 31 January 2008, while the second hatched on 1 February. Both hatchlings were males. 
Komodo dragons have the [ZW] ZW chromosomal [sex-determination system] sex-determination system , as opposed to the [mammalian XY system] mammalian XY system . Male progeny prove Flora's unfertilized eggs were [haploid] haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become [diploid] diploid (2n) (by being fertilized by a [polar body] polar body , or by chromosome duplication without [cell division] cell division ), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the [meiosis] meiosis reduction-divisions in her [ovaries] ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z [chromosome] chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop, meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species.
It has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated [ecological niche] ecological niche (such as an island) and by [parthenogenesis] parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young). Despite the advantages of such an adaptation, zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis may be detrimental to genetic diversity. 
=== Encounters with humans ===
Attacks on humans are rare, but Komodo dragons have been responsible for several human fatalities, both in the wild and in captivity. According to data from [Komodo National Park] Komodo National Park spanning a 38-year period between 1974 and 2012, there were 24 reported attacks on humans, five of them fatal. Most of the victims were local villagers living around the national park. 
== Conservation ==
The Komodo dragon is classified by the [IUCN] IUCN as [Endangered] Endangered and is listed on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List . The species' sensitivity to natural and human-made threats has long been recognized by conservationists, zoological societies, and the Indonesian government. [Komodo National Park] Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar. Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid Komodo dragon conservation. 
Komodo dragons generally avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about 100 metres (330 ft). Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away. If cornered, they may react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are either not reputable or have subsequently been interpreted as defensive bites. Only very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by atypical individuals who lost their fear of humans. 
Volcanic activity, earthquakes, loss of habitat, fire, tourism, loss of prey due to [poaching] poaching , and illegal poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon. A major future threat to the species is [climate change] climate change via both [aridification] aridification and [sea level rise] sea level rise , which can affect the low-lying habitats and valleys that the Komodo dragon depends on, as Komodo dragons do not range into the higher-altitude regions of the islands they inhabit. Based on projections, climate change will lead to a decline in suitable habitat of 8.4%, 30.2%, or 71% by 2050 depending on the [climate change scenario] climate change scenario . Without effective conservation actions, populations on Flores are extirpated in all scenarios, while in the more extreme scenarios, only the populations on Komodo and Rinca persist in highly reduced numbers. Rapid [climate change mitigation] climate change mitigation is crucial for conserving the species in the wild. Other scientists have disputed the conclusions about the effects of climate change on Komodo dragon populations. 
Under Appendix I of [CITES] CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), commercial international trade of Komodo dragon skins or specimens is prohibited. Despite this, there are occasional reports of illegal attempts to trade in live Komodo dragons. The most recent attempt was in March 2019, when Indonesian police in the [East Java] East Java city of [Surabaya] Surabaya reported that a criminal network had been caught trying to smuggle 41 young Komodo dragons out of Indonesia. The plan was said to include shipping the animals to several other countries in Southeast Asia through Singapore. It was hoped that the animals could be sold for up to 500 million [rupiah] rupiah (around US$35,000) each. It was believed that the Komodo dragons had been smuggled out of [East Nusa Tenggara] East Nusa Tenggara province through the port at [Ende] Ende in central Flores. 
In 2013, the total population of Komodo dragons in the wild was assessed as 3,222 individuals, declining to 3,092 in 2014 and 3,014 in 2015. Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands (Komodo and Rinca), but decreased on smaller islands, such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang, likely due to diminishing prey availability. On [Padar] Padar , a former population of Komodo dragons has recently become [extirpated] extirpated , of which the last individuals were seen in 1975. It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon died out on Padar following a major decline of populations of large [ungulate] ungulate prey, for which poaching was most likely responsible. 
=== In captivity ===
Komodo dragons have long been sought-after zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce in captivity. A pair of Komodo dragons was displayed at the [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo in New York in September 1926, but they only lasted a couple of months, dying in October and November 1926. The first Komodo dragons were displayed at [London Zoo] London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 in the United States at the [National Zoo in Washington, D.C.] National Zoo in Washington, D.C. , but it lived for only two years. More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of the animals in captivity at the time proved very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological Park. Studies were done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor , eventually allowing for more successful management and breeding of the dragons in captivity.  [Surabaya Zoo] Surabaya Zoo in Indonesia has been breeding Komodo dragons since 1990 and had 134 dragons in 2022, the largest collection outside its natural habitat. As of May 2009, there were 35 North American, 13 European, one Singaporean, two African, and two Australian institutions which housed captive Komodo dragons. In 2016, four Komodo dragons were transferred from Bronx zoo to [Madras Crocodile Bank Trust] Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India. 
A variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals become relatively tame within a short time, and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar keepers. Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects, including shovels, cans, plastic rings, and shoes. This behavior does not seem to be ""food-motivated predatory behavior"". 
Even seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive, especially when the animal's territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured [Phil Bronstein] Phil Bronstein , the then-husband of actress [Sharon Stone] Sharon Stone , when he entered its enclosure at the [Los Angeles Zoo] Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon. Although he survived, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.

Snow Leopard,Snow leopard,"
The snow leopard snow leopard ( Panthera uncia Panthera uncia Panthera uncia ) is a [species] species of large cat in the genus Panthera [Panthera] Panthera of the [family] family  [Felidae] Felidae . The species is native to the mountain ranges of [Central] Central and [South Asia] South Asia . It is listed as [Vulnerable] Vulnerable on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by [poaching] poaching and [habitat destruction] habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits [alpine] alpine and [subalpine zones] subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft), ranging from eastern [Afghanistan] Afghanistan , the [Himalayas] Himalayas and the [Tibetan Plateau] Tibetan Plateau to southern [Siberia] Siberia , [Mongolia] Mongolia and [western China] western China . In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
[Taxonomically] Taxonomically , the snow leopard was long classified in the [monotypic genus] monotypic genus  Uncia Uncia . Since [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among Panthera Panthera species, it has since been considered a member of that [genus] genus . Two subspecies were described based on [morphological] morphological differences, but [genetic] genetic differences between the two have not yet been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a [monotypic species] monotypic species . The species is widely depicted in [Kyrgyz culture] Kyrgyz culture .
== Naming and etymology ==
The [Old French] Old French word once once , which was intended to be used for the [Eurasian lynx] Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx Lynx lynx ), is where the [Latin] Latin name uncia uncia and the English word ounce both originate. Once Once is believed to have originated from a previous form of the word lynx lynx through a process known as [false splitting] false splitting . The word once once was originally considered to be pronounced as l'once l'once , where l' l' stands for the [elided form] elided form of the word la la ('the') in French. Once Once was then understood to be the name of the animal. The word panther panther derives from the [classical Latin] classical Latin  panthēra panthēra , itself from the [ancient Greek] ancient Greek πάνθηρ pánthēr pánthēr , which was used for spotted cats. 
== Taxonomy ==
Felis uncia Felis uncia was the [scientific name] scientific name used by [Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber] Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777 who [described] described a snow leopard based on an earlier description by [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon , assuming that the cat occurred along the [Barbary Coast] Barbary Coast , in [Persia] Persia , [East India] East India and [China] China . The [genus] genus name Uncia Uncia was proposed by [John Edward Gray] John Edward Gray in 1854 for Asian cats with a long and thick tail.  Felis irbis, Felis irbis, proposed by [Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg] Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1830, was a skin of a female snow leopard collected in the [Altai Mountains] Altai Mountains . He also clarified that several [leopard] leopard ( P. pardus P. pardus ) skins were previously misidentified as snow leopard skins.  Felis uncioides Felis uncioides proposed by [Thomas Horsfield] Thomas Horsfield in 1855 was a snow leopard skin from Nepal in the collection of the Museum of the [East India Company] East India Company . 
Uncia uncia Uncia uncia was used by [Reginald Innes Pocock] Reginald Innes Pocock in 1930 when he reviewed skins and skulls of Panthera Panthera species from Asia. He also described morphological differences between snow leopard and leopard skins.  Panthera baikalensis-romanii Panthera baikalensis-romanii proposed by a Russian scientist in 2000 was a dark brown snow leopard skin from the [Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky District] Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky District in southern [Transbaikal] Transbaikal . 
The snow leopard was long classified in the [monotypic genus] monotypic genus  Uncia Uncia . They were subordinated to the genus Panthera Panthera based on results of [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies. 
Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for the recognition of [subspecies] subspecies . Results of a [phylogeographic] phylogeographic analysis indicate that three subspecies should be recognised: 
This view has been both contested and supported by different researchers. 
An extinct subspecies Panthera uncia pyrenaica [Panthera uncia pyrenaica] Panthera uncia pyrenaica was described in 2022 based on [fossil] fossil material found in France that was dated to the early [Middle Pleistocene] Middle Pleistocene around [0.57 to 0.53] 0.57 to 0.53 million years ago . 
== Evolution ==
Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the [DNA sequence] DNA sequence sampled across the living [Felidae] Felidae , the snow leopard forms a [sister group] sister group with the [tiger] tiger ( P. tigris P. tigris ). The [genetic divergence] genetic divergence time of this group is estimated at [4.62 to 1.82] 4.62 to 1.82 million years ago . The snow leopard and the tiger probably diverged between [3.7 to 2.7] 3.7 to 2.7 million years ago .  Panthera Panthera originates most likely in northern Central Asia. Panthera blytheae [Panthera blytheae] Panthera blytheae  [excavated] excavated in western Tibet's [Ngari Prefecture] Ngari Prefecture has been initially described the oldest known Panthera Panthera species and exhibits skull characteristics similar to the snow leopard, though its taxonomic placement has been disputed by other researchers who suggest that the species likely belongs to a different genus. The [mitochondrial genomes] mitochondrial genomes of the snow leopard, the leopard and the [lion] lion ( P. leo P. leo ) are more similar to each other than their [nuclear genomes] nuclear genomes , indicating that their ancestors [hybridised] hybridised at some point in their [evolution] evolution . 
Fossils of the snow leopard found in the Pabbi Hills of Pakistan were dated to the [Early Pleistocene] Early Pleistocene . 
== Characteristics ==
The snow leopard's fur is whitish to grey with black spots on the head and neck, with larger [rosettes] rosettes on the back, [flanks] flanks and bushy tail. Its [muzzle] muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its [nasal cavities] nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs measuring 5 to 12 cm (2.0 to 4.7 in) in length, and its underbelly is whitish. They are stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than other cats of the genus Panthera Panthera , reaching a shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail is 80 to 105 cm (31 to 41 in) long. Males average 45 to 55 kg (99 to 121 lb), and females 35 to 40 kg (77 to 88 lb). Occasionally, large males reaching 75 kg (165 lb) have been recorded, and small females under 25 kg (55 lb). Its [canine teeth] canine teeth are 28.6 mm (1.13 in) long and are more slender than those of the other Panthera Panthera species. 
The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in cold, mountainous environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss, and its broad paws effectively distribute the body weight for walking on snow. Fur on the undersides of the paws enhances its grip on steep and unstable surfaces, and helps to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps the cat to balance in rocky terrain. The tail is very thick due to fat storage, and is covered in a thick layer of fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep. 
The snow leopard differs from the other Panthera Panthera species by a shorter muzzle, an elevated [forehead] forehead , a vertical chin and a less developed posterior process of the lower [jaw] jaw . Despite its partly [ossified] ossified  [hyoid bone] hyoid bone , a snow leopard cannot [roar] roar , as its 9 mm (0.35 in) short [vocal folds] vocal folds provide little resistance to airflow. Its nasal openings are large in relation to the length of its [skull] skull and width of its [palate] palate ; thanks to their size the volume of air inhaled with each breath is optimised, and the cold dry air becomes warmer. It is not especially adapted to [high-altitude hypoxia] high-altitude hypoxia . 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The snow leopard is distributed from the west of [Lake Baikal] Lake Baikal through southern Siberia, in the [Kunlun Mountains] Kunlun Mountains , Altai Mountains, [Sayan] Sayan and [Tannu-Ola Mountains] Tannu-Ola Mountains , in the [Tian Shan] Tian Shan , through [Tajikistan] Tajikistan , [Kyrgyzstan] Kyrgyzstan , [Uzbekistan] Uzbekistan and [Kazakhstan] Kazakhstan to the [Hindu Kush] Hindu Kush in eastern Afghanistan, [Karakoram] Karakoram in northern [Pakistan] Pakistan , in the [Pamir Mountains] Pamir Mountains , the Tibetan Plateau and in the high elevations of the [Himalayas] Himalayas in [India] India , [Nepal] Nepal and [Bhutan] Bhutan . In Mongolia, they inhabit the Mongolian and Gobi Altai Mountains and the [Khangai Mountains] Khangai Mountains . In [Tibet] Tibet , they occur up to the [Altyn-Tagh] Altyn-Tagh in the north. They inhabit [alpine] alpine and [subalpine zones] subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500 m (9,800 to 14,800 ft), but also lives at lower elevations in the northern part of their range. 
Potential snow leopard habitat in the Indian Himalayas is estimated at less than 90,000 km (35,000 sq mi) in [Jammu and Kashmir] Jammu and Kashmir , [Ladakh] Ladakh , [Uttarakhand] Uttarakhand , [Himachal Pradesh] Himachal Pradesh , [Sikkim] Sikkim and [Arunachal Pradesh] Arunachal Pradesh , of which about 34,000 km (13,000 sq mi) is considered good habitat, and 14.4% is protected. In the beginning of the 1990s, the Indian snow leopard population was estimated at 200–600 individuals living across about 25 protected areas. The Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India (SPAI) Programme counted the number of snow leopards between 2019 and 2023 and found their number to be 718, with 477 in [Ladakh] Ladakh , 124 in [Uttarakhand] Uttarakhand , 51 in Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Arunachal Pradesh, 21 in Sikkim, and nine in Jammu and Kashmir. 
In summer, the snow leopard usually lives above the [tree line] tree line on [alpine meadows] alpine meadows and in rocky regions at elevations of 2,700 to 6,000 m (8,900 to 19,700 ft). In winter, they descend to elevations around 1,200 to 2,000 m (3,900 to 6,600 ft). They prefer rocky, broken terrain, and can move in 85 cm (33 in) deep snow, but prefers to use existing trails made by other animals. 
Snow leopards were recorded by [camera traps] camera traps at 16 locations in northeastern Afghanistan's isolated [Wakhan Corridor] Wakhan Corridor . 
== Behavior and ecology ==
The snow leopard's vocalizations include meowing, grunting, [prusten] prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling. 
It is [solitary] solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. They mostly rest near cliffs and ridges that provide vantage points and shade. In Nepal's [Shey Phoksundo National Park] Shey Phoksundo National Park , the home ranges of five adult [radio-collared] radio-collared snow leopards largely overlapped, though they rarely met. Their individual home ranges ranged from 12 to 39 km (4.6 to 15.1 sq mi). Males moved between 0.5 and 5.45 km (0.31 and 3.39 mi) per day, and females between 0.2 and 2.25 km (0.12 and 1.40 mi), measured in straight lines between survey points. Since they often zigzagged in the precipitous terrain, they actually moved up to 7 km (4.3 mi) in a single night. Up to 10 individuals inhabit an area of 100 km (39 sq mi); in habitats with sparse prey, an area of 1,000 km (390 sq mi) usually supports only five individuals. 
A study in the [Gobi Desert] Gobi Desert from 2008 to 2014 revealed that adult males used a mean home range of 144–270 km (56–104 sq mi), while adult females ranged in areas of 83–165 km (32–64 sq mi). Their home ranges overlapped less than 20%. These results indicate that about 40% of the 170 protected areas in their range countries are smaller than the home range of a single male snow leopard. 
Snow leopards leave [scent marks] scent marks to indicate their territories and common travel routes. They scrape the ground with the hind feet before depositing [urine] urine or [feces] feces , but also [spray] spray urine onto rocks. Their urine contains many characteristic low molecular weight compounds with diverse functional groups including [pentanol] pentanol , [hexanol] hexanol , [heptanol] heptanol , [3-octanone] 3-octanone , [nonanal] nonanal and [indole] indole , which possibly play a role in chemical communication. 
=== Hunting and diet ===
The snow leopard is a [carnivore] carnivore and actively [hunts] hunts its [prey] prey . Its preferred wild prey species are [Himalayan blue sheep] Himalayan blue sheep ( Pseudois nayaur Pseudois nayaur ), [Himalayan tahr] Himalayan tahr ( Hemitragus jemlahicus Hemitragus jemlahicus ), [argali] argali ( Ovis ammon Ovis ammon ), [markhor] markhor ( Capra falconeri Capra falconeri ) and [wild goat] wild goat ( C. aegagrus C. aegagrus ). It also preys on domestic livestock. It prefers prey ranging in weight from 36 to 76 kg (79 to 168 lb), but also hunts smaller mammals such as [Himalayan marmot] Himalayan marmot ( Marmota himalayana Marmota himalayana ), [pika] pika and [vole] vole species. Its diet depends on prey availability and varies across its range and season. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on Himalayan blue sheep, [Siberian ibex] Siberian ibex ( C. sibirica C. sibirica ), [white-bellied musk deer] white-bellied musk deer ( Moschus leucogaster Moschus leucogaster ) and [wild boar] wild boar ( Sus scrofa Sus scrofa ). In the [Karakoram] Karakoram , [Tian Shan] Tian Shan , Altai and Mongolia's Tost Mountains, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex, [Thorold's deer] Thorold's deer ( Cervus albirostris Cervus albirostris ), [Siberian roe deer] Siberian roe deer ( Capreolus pygargus Capreolus pygargus ) and argali. Snow leopard feces collected in northern Pakistan also contained remains of [rhesus macaque] rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta Macaca mulatta ), [masked palm civet] masked palm civet ( Paguma larvata Paguma larvata ), [Cape hare] Cape hare ( Lepus capensis Lepus capensis ), [house mouse] house mouse ( Mus musculus Mus musculus ), [Kashmir field mouse] Kashmir field mouse ( Apodemus rusiges Apodemus rusiges ), [grey dwarf hamster] grey dwarf hamster ( Cricetulus migratorius Cricetulus migratorius ) and [Turkestan rat] Turkestan rat ( Rattus pyctoris Rattus pyctoris ). In 2017, a snow leopard was photographed carrying a freshly killed [woolly flying squirrel] woolly flying squirrel ( Eupetaurus cinereus Eupetaurus cinereus ) near [Gangotri National Park] Gangotri National Park . In Mongolia, [domestic sheep] domestic sheep comprises less than 20% of its diet, although wild prey has been reduced and interactions with people are common. It is capable of killing most ungulates in its habitat, with the probable exception of the adult male [wild yak] wild yak . It also eats grass and twigs. 
The snow leopard actively pursues prey down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of its initial leap to chase animals for up to 300 m (980 ft). Then it drags the prey to a safe location and consumes all edible parts of the carcass. It can survive on a single Himalayan blue sheep for two weeks before hunting again, and one adult individual apparently needs 20–30 adult blue sheep per year. Snow leopards have been recorded to hunt successfully in pairs, especially mating pairs. 
The snow leopard is easily driven away from livestock and readily abandons kills, often without defending itself. Only two attacks on humans have been reported, both near [Almaty] Almaty in Kazakhstan, and neither were fatal. In 1940, a [rabid] rabid snow leopard attacked two men; and an old, toothless [emaciated] emaciated individual attacked a person passing by. 
=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Snow leopards become [sexually mature] sexually mature at two to three years, and normally live for 15–18 years in the wild. In captivity they can live for up to 25 years. [Oestrus] Oestrus typically lasts five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in [the usual felid posture] the usual felid posture , from 12 to 36 times a day. They are unusual among large cats in that they have a well-defined birth peak. They usually [mate] mate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Females have a [gestation period] gestation period of 90–100 days, and the cubs are born between April and June. A [litter] litter usually consists of two to three cubs, in exceptional cases there can be up to seven. 
The female gives birth in a rocky den or crevice lined with fur shed from her underside. The cubs are born blind and helpless, although already with a thick coat of fur, and weigh 320 to 567 g (11.3 to 20.0 oz). Their eyes open at around seven days, and the cubs can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks. The cubs leave the den when they are around two to four months of age. Three radio-collared snow leopards in Mongolia's Tost Mountains gave birth between late April and late June. Two female cubs started to part from their mothers at the age of 20 to 21 months, but reunited with them several times for a few days over a period of 4–7 months. One male cub separated from his mother at the age of about 22 months, but stayed in her vicinity for a month and moved out of his natal range at 23 months of age. 
The snow leopard has a [generation length] generation length of eight years. 
== Threats ==
Major threats to the population include poaching and illegal trade of its skins and body parts. Between 1999 and 2002, three live snow leopard cubs and 16 skins were [confiscated] confiscated , 330 [traps] traps were destroyed and 110 poachers were arrested in Kyrgyzstan. [Undercover operations] Undercover operations in the country revealed an illegal trade network with links to Russia and China via Kazakhstan. The major skin trade center in the region is the city of [Kashgar] Kashgar in [Xinjiang] Xinjiang . In Tibet and Mongolia, skins are used for traditional dresses, and meat in [traditional Tibetan medicine] traditional Tibetan medicine to cure [kidney] kidney problems; bones are used in [traditional Chinese] traditional Chinese and [Mongolian medicine] Mongolian medicine for treating [rheumatism] rheumatism , injuries and pain of human bones and [tendons] tendons . Between 1996 and 2002, 37 skins were found in wildlife markets and tourist shops in Mongolia. Between 2003 and 2016, 710 skins were traded, of which 288 skins were confiscated. In China, an estimated 103 to 236 animals are poached every year, in Mongolia between 34 and 53, in Pakistan between 23 and 53, in India from 21 to 45, and in Tajikistan 20 to 25. In 2016, a survey of Chinese websites revealed 15 advertisements for 44 snow leopard products; the dealers offered skins, canine teeth, claws and a tongue. In September 2014, nine snow leopard skins were found during a market survey in Afghanistan. 
[Greenhouse gas] Greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a shift of the [treeline] treeline in the Himalayas and a shrinking of the [alpine zone] alpine zone , which may reduce snow leopard habitat by an estimated 30%. 
Where snow leopards prey on domestic [livestock] livestock , they are subject to [human–wildlife conflict] human–wildlife conflict . The loss of natural prey due to overgrazing by livestock, poaching, and defense of livestock are the major drivers for the ever decreasing snow leopard population. Livestock also cause habitat degradation, which, alongside the increasing use of forests for fuel, reduces snow leopard habitat. 
== Conservation ==
The snow leopard is listed in [CITES Appendix I] CITES Appendix I . They have been listed as threatened with extinction in Schedule I of the [Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals] Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals since 1985. Hunting snow leopards has been prohibited in Kyrgyzstan since the 1950s. In India, the snow leopard is granted the highest level of protection under the [Wildlife Protection Act, 1972] Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 , and hunting is sentenced with [imprisonment] imprisonment of 3–7 years. In Nepal, they have been legally protected since 1973, with penalties of 5–15 years in prison and a [fine] fine for poaching and trading them. Since 1978, they have been listed in the [Soviet Union] Soviet Union ’s Red Book and is still inscribed today in the [Red Data Book of the Russian Federation] Red Data Book of the Russian Federation as threatened with extinction. Hunting snow leopards is only permitted for the purposes of conservation and monitoring, and to eliminate a threat to the life of humans and livestock. [Smuggling] Smuggling of snow leopard body parts is punished with imprisonment and a [fine] fine . Hunting snow leopards has been prohibited in Afghanistan since 1986. In China, they have been protected by law since 1989; hunting and trading snow leopards or their body parts constitute a [criminal] criminal offence that is punishable by the [confiscation] confiscation of property, a fine and a [sentence] sentence of at least 10 years in prison. They have been protected in Bhutan since 1995. 
At the end of 2020, 35 cameras were installed on the outskirts of Almaty, Kazakhstan in hopes to catch footage of snow leopards. In November 2021, it was announced by the Russian World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that snow leopards were spotted 65 times on these cameras in the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains since the cameras were installed. 
=== Global Snow Leopard Forum ===
In 2013, government leaders and officials from all 12 countries encompassing the snow leopard's range (Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) came together at the Global Snow Leopard Forum (GSLF) initiated by the then-President of Kyrgyzstan [Almazbek Atambayev] Almazbek Atambayev , and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the government of Kyrgyzstan. The meeting was held in [Bishkek] Bishkek , and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow leopard populations, and to safeguard its fragile environment. The event brought together many partners, including [NGOs] NGOs like the [Snow Leopard Conservancy] Snow Leopard Conservancy , the [Snow Leopard Trust] Snow Leopard Trust , and the [Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union] Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union . Also supporting the initiative were the Snow Leopard Network, the [World Bank] World Bank 's [Global Tiger Initiative] Global Tiger Initiative , the [United Nations Development Programme] United Nations Development Programme , the [World Wild Fund for Nature] World Wild Fund for Nature , the [United States Agency for International Development] United States Agency for International Development , and [Global Environment Facility] Global Environment Facility . 
=== In captivity ===
The [Moscow Zoo] Moscow Zoo exhibited the first captive snow leopard in 1872 that had been caught in [Turkestan] Turkestan . In Kyrgyzstan, 420 live snow leopards were caught between 1936 and 1988 and exported to zoos around the world. The [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo housed a live snow leopard in 1903; this was the first ever specimen exhibited in a North American zoo. The first [captive bred] captive bred snow leopard cubs were born in the 1990s in the [Beijing Zoo] Beijing Zoo . The Snow Leopard [Species Survival Plan] Species Survival Plan was initiated in 1984; by 1986, [American zoos] American zoos held 234 individuals. 
== Cultural significance ==
The snow leopard is widely used in [heraldry] heraldry and as an emblem in Central Asia. The Aq Bars [Aq Bars] Aq Bars ('White Leopard') is a political symbol of the [Tatars] Tatars , [Kazakhs] Kazakhs , and [Bulgars] Bulgars . A mythical winged Aq Bars Aq Bars is depicted on the national [coat of arms of Tatarstan] coat of arms of Tatarstan , the seal of the city of [Samarqand] Samarqand , Uzbekistan and the old coat of arms of [Astana] Astana . A snow leopard is depicted on the official seal of [Almaty] Almaty and on the former 10,000 [Kazakhstani tenge] Kazakhstani tenge banknote. In Kyrgyzstan, it is used in highly stylized form in the modern emblem of the capital [Bishkek] Bishkek , and the same art has been integrated into the badge of the [Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association] Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association . It is also considered to be a sacred creature by the [Kyrgyz people] Kyrgyz people . A crowned snow leopard features in the arms of [Shushensky District] Shushensky District in Russia. It is the [state animal] state animal of [Ladakh] Ladakh and [Himachal Pradesh] Himachal Pradesh in India. 
The 1978 book The Snow Leopard [The Snow Leopard] The Snow Leopard is an account by [Peter Matthiessen] Peter Matthiessen about his two-month journey through the [Dolpo] Dolpo region of the Nepal Himalayas in search of the snow leopard.

Indian Star Tortoise,Indian star tortoise,"
The Indian star tortoise Indian star tortoise ( Geochelone elegans Geochelone elegans Geochelone elegans ) is a threatened [tortoise] tortoise  [species] species native to [India] India , [Pakistan] Pakistan and [Sri Lanka] Sri Lanka where it inhabits dry areas and scrub forest. It has been listed as [Vulnerable] Vulnerable on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List since 2016, as the population is thought to comprise more than 10,000 individuals, but with a declining trend. It is threatened by [habitat loss] habitat loss and [poaching] poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. It was upgraded to [CITES Appendix I] CITES Appendix I in 2019 by full consensus among all member states, giving it the highest level of international protection from commercial trade. Conservation group [TRAFFIC] TRAFFIC found 6,040 were seized globally that were intended to be sold in the pet trade. Currently they are commonly bred in many countries to be sold as pets.
== Anatomy and morphology ==
The [carapace] carapace of G. elegans G. elegans is very convex, with dorsal shields often forming humps; the lateral margins are nearly vertical; the posterior margin is somewhat expanded and strongly serrated. It has no nuchal scute, and the supracaudal is undivided, and curved inward in the male; the shields are strongly striated concentrically. The first vertebral scute is longer than broad, and the others are broader than long, with the third at least as broad as the corresponding costal. The [plastron] plastron is large, truncated or openly notched in front, and deeply notched and bifid behind; the suture between the humerals is much longer than that between the femorals; the suture between the pectorals is very short; the axillary and inguinal sutures are rather small. The head is moderate in size, with the forehead swollen, convex, and covered with rather small and irregular shields; the beak is feebly hooked, bi- or tricuspid; the edges of the jaws are denticulated; the alveolar ridge of the upper jaw is strong. The outer-anterior face of the fore limbs have numerous unequal-sized, large, imbricate, bony, pointed tubercles; the heel has large, more or less spur-like tubercles; a group of large conical or subconical tubercles is found on the hinder side of the thigh. The carapace is black, with yellow areolae from which yellow streaks radiate; these streaks are usually narrow and very numerous. The plastron likewise has black and yellow, radiating streaks. The Indian star tortoise can grow to 10 inches long. 
The patterning, although highly contrasting, is [disruptive] disruptive and breaks the outline of the tortoise as it sits in the shade of grass or vegetation. They are mostly [herbivorous] herbivorous and feed on [grasses] grasses , fallen [fruit] fruit , [flowers] flowers , and leaves of succulent plants, and will occasionally eat [carrion] carrion . In captivity, however, they should never be fed meat.
The [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism of adult Indian star tortoises is quite apparent. Females are considerably larger than their male counterparts. In addition, the females' plastrons are much flatter than those of the males, which have a concave shape.
The shape of this creature is presumed to be specially adapted to naturally assist it to return to a stable stance after it has been turned over. Mathematicians Gábor Domokos of the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics] Budapest University of Technology and Economics and Péter Várkonyi of [Princeton University] Princeton University designed a homogeneous object called a gömböc [gömböc] gömböc that has exactly one unstable balance point and exactly one stable balance point. Just as a bottom-weighted (nonhomogeneous weight distribution) sphere would always return to the same upright position, they found it was possible to construct a shape that behaves the same way. After that, they noted the similarity to the Indian star tortoise and subsequently tested 30 turtles by turning them upside down. They found many of them to be self-righting. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Indian star tortoises are native to parts of western and southeastern India, the island of Sri Lanka, and southeastern Pakistan. Although there are no recognized subspecies, there are variations in color and morphology between the tortoises found in the different regions. The Indian star tortoises found in southeastern India tend to be a bit smaller and have a lighter, more contrasting pattern on their shell compared to the ones found in northern India. The tortoises in Sri Lanka tend to have wider yellow markings and are generally larger than the tortoises found in India. Little used to be known about the phylogeographic differentiation in the Indian star tortoises until a study done by Gaur in 2006. The study revealed that the tortoises from the distribution patches between India and Sri Lanka are indeed distinct. These tortoises are known to widely inhabit many different types of habitats across India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. They have displayed a very high tolerance to areas with seasonally dry and wet habitats. Star tortoises have been found in rainy deciduous forests, dry grasslands, and even semi-desert lands. 
== Reproduction and young ==
Females typically reach sexual maturity around 8–12 years old, while males reach sexual maturity around 6–8 years old. Males will compete for mates and assert dominance by ramming into other males and trying to flip them onto their backs. Around 60–90 days after the female mates, she will search and try to find an area to dig a nest where she will then lay her eggs. Female star tortoises can lay anywhere from one to nine clutches annually, with each clutch containing one to ten eggs. After she lays her eggs, she will cover them back up with the sand and the eggs have to be incubated for 50–180 days. The egg of a star tortoise is a hard but also brittle shell that usually weighs 12-21 grams each. When the eggs are first laid they are a pinkish translucent color, then after 2–3 weeks, the eggs become white. The determination of the sex of the tortoises is temperature-dependent. With temperatures between 28-30 degrees Celsius, mostly males will hatch. Temperatures between 31-32 degrees Celsius will result in mostly females hatching. Instead of having a distinctive star, the hatchlings' carapace is a black or brown color with yellow rectangular blotches. 
== Illegal pet trade and CITES ==
Indian star tortoises are the most transported and illegally sold tortoise and turtle. Although they are native to India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, they are found all over Southeast Asia, the United States, Europe, and many other countries. There is such a high demand for these tortoises, that roughly 10,000-20,000 are taken from the wild each year and sold around the world. Only around 3,000 of those tortoises are rescued from smugglers and markets. There were over 6,000 Indian star tortoises seized from illegal trade across India, Thailand, and Bangladesh in 2017. Tortoises can go many days without food and are very quiet, which makes them easier to smuggle. Smugglers will collect a large amount of the tortoises, tape their legs, and put all of them in small containers, bags, and boxes. Even though they are smuggled in large amounts, many of the tortoises end up dying before they even get sold due to the harsh conditions they endure such as stress, suffocation, cracked shells, and not being able to move. The illegal pet trade continues to devastate the populations of these tortoises and could even potentially cause extinction among the species. CITES is broken up into three different appendixes depending on the level of protection needed and is currently protecting over 38,000 species. In 2019, the Indian star tortoises were added to Appendix I of CITES after being listed under Appendix II for many years. This means that the commercial trade of these tortoises or even parts of the tortoises is completely banned. In 2020 and  2021, after being added to Appendix I, the Wildlife Protection Society of India reported that authorities had seized over 3,500 tortoises. Currently they are commonly bred in many countries to be sold as pets.
== Disease ==
In addition to the threat of the illegal pet trade and habitat loss, diseases can also be a huge threat to the population of the Indian star tortoises. Star tortoises are extremely susceptible to pneumonia and respiratory diseases, which often lead to fatalities among individuals. Human handling and the transportation of these tortoises under inhumane conditions will increase the risk of diseases and parasites causing a large number of deaths. Many of them caught for the illegal pet trade are at high risk of dying from unexpected diseases and many do not end up making it to a home to even become a pet.

Pink Fairy Armadillo,Pink fairy armadillo,"
The pink fairy armadillo pink fairy armadillo ( Chlamyphorus truncatus Chlamyphorus truncatus Chlamyphorus truncatus ) is the smallest species of [armadillo] armadillo , first described by [Richard Harlan] Richard Harlan in 1825. This solitary, desert-adapted animal is endemic to the deserts and scrub lands of central [Argentina] Argentina . The pink fairy armadillo is closely related to the only other fairy armadillo, the [greater fairy armadillo] greater fairy armadillo .
Pink fairy armadillos have small eyes, silky yellowish white fur, and flexible dorsal shells that are attached to their bodies solely by thin dorsal membranes. Their spatula-shaped tails protrude from vertical plates at the blunt rear of their shells. They exhibit [nocturnal] nocturnal and [solitary] solitary habits and feed themselves largely on insects, worms, snails, and various plant parts. The pink fairy armadillo has a unique ability to bury itself in a matter of seconds, using its specialized claws to dig into sandy or loamy soils. This behavior helps protect the armadillo from predators and extreme temperatures, as well as conserve moisture in its arid habitat. 
The [conservation status] conservation status of pink fairy armadillos is uncertain, and it is listed as [Data Deficient] Data Deficient by the [IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . The decline in population for this species has generally been attributed to farming activities and predators including domestic dogs and cats. Pink fairy armadillos are found less commonly than they were a few decades ago, and the field sightings have been rare and incidental. 
Individuals caught in the wild had a tendency to die during or a couple days after  transport from their natural habitat to captive facilities. There is a sole record for the longevity of a pink fairy armadillo that was held in captivity more than four years; however, that particular case lacks scientific description. Armadillos' evolutionary distinctiveness, combined with their restricted geographic range, ongoing threats, and rarity, make  conservation extremely urgent for these species. 
== Evolutionary origins ==
At present, fairy armadillos have the least molecular data available among all families of armadillos. The subfamily [Chlamyphorinae] Chlamyphorinae includes only two non-extinct species: Chlamyphorus truncatus Chlamyphorus truncatus , the pink fairy armadillo, and Calyptophractus retusus [Calyptophractus retusus] Calyptophractus retusus , the greater fairy armadillo. These two species are [morphologically] morphologically similar: both have notably reduced eyes and reinforced forearms that support enlarged digging claws. They are also one of the few mammals that lack visible external ears. Both species are specialized to a [subterranean lifestyle] subterranean lifestyle which was developed in their ancestral lineage sometime between 32 and 17 Mya. 
Both species have geographically separated distributions, and both are strictly nocturnal, but the details of their ecology and their [population biology] population biology remain unknown. The similarities can be explained either by the presence of a shared common ancestry, which would place both species in the same [clade] clade (making them [monophyletic] monophyletic ), or by the result of [adaptive convergence] adaptive convergence due to extreme selective pressures induced by their lifestyle (suggesting them to be [diphyletic] diphyletic ). A study in 2012 of several of their genes concluded that they were monophyletic, estimating the split between the two species to have occurred around 17 ± 3 Mya, around the transition between the [Early Miocene] Early Miocene and the [Middle Miocene] Middle Miocene . 
Both species are rare in the field and are fairly elusive, so the [phylogenetic] phylogenetic affinities of fairy armadillos have been tested only once. Research conducted in 2009 supported the idea that the three previously identified subfamilies [Dasypodinae] Dasypodinae , [Euphractinae] Euphractinae , and [Tolypeutinae] Tolypeutinae of armadillos, which separated shortly after the [Eocene-Oligocene transition] Eocene-Oligocene transition , were monophyletic. Chlamyphorinae, the subfamily including the pink fairy armadillo, was found to show phylogenetic affinities with the clade Tolypeutinae. This was a significant step in defining the previously completely unknown phylogenetic position of this armadillo subfamily within Cingulata. Later, the separation of the fairy armadillo subfamily from their sister-group of Tolypeutinae was estimated to have occurred 32 ± 3 Mya. 
Fairy armadillos have previously been classified within the subfamily Euphractinae. However, current opinion is that the antiquity and uniqueness of pink fairy armadillos is best accounted for by retaining the subfamily Chlamyphorinae. 
== Range and habitat ==
Pink fairy armadillos are nocturnal burrowing mammals endemic to the [xeric] xeric environment in central [Argentina] Argentina . They have been found south of [Mendoza province] Mendoza province as well as north of [Rio Negro] Rio Negro and south of [Buenos Aires] Buenos Aires . This narrow range contains a unique and crucial habitat for the pink fairy armadillo. It lives in scrubby grasslands that display a variety of thin Larrea [Larrea] Larrea and Portulaca [Portulaca] Portulaca shrubs during spring and summer periods. It also resides in sandy plains and dunes. 
The pink fairy armadillo is classified as a subterranean armadillo that is extremely sensitive to environmental changes and stress. As an example, sudden environmental changes that could affect pink fairy armadillos include temperature and [soil quality] soil quality . In order for them to survive and maintain stability, they must occupy undisturbed places that contain sufficient amounts of compact sand and hiding places. This also refers to possible captivity conditions for this animal due to its desert-adapted characteristics. 
== Dietary habits ==
The pink fairy armadillo is classified as a [fossorial] fossorial , [generalist] generalist , [insectivore] insectivore . Ants and larvae are its main food source while underground. While those are its primary sources of food, the armadillos are known to also eat worms, snails, and various insects. If these insects and invertebrates cannot be found, plant leaves and roots make a good secondary dietary option for their underground lifestyle. In captivity, this animal was observed to willingly accept such foods as watermelon, avocado shells with avocado flesh, and Mazuri Insectivore Diet. 
== Description ==
The pink fairy armadillo is 90–115 mm (3.5–4.5 in) long, and typically weighs about 120 g (4.2 oz). This species is the smallest living armadillo and is among the least known. 
=== Thermoregulation and external shell ===
Its fine hair has been found to be beneficial for [thermoregulation] thermoregulation in an environment with highly variable temperatures. Night temperatures in Argentinian plains can get very low, and since the armadillo is nocturnal it needs the fur to conserve heat while it is being active outside its burrow.
Armadillos are well known for leathery shells covering the majority of the [dorsal] dorsal side. The pink fairy armadillo has this characteristic as well, but its shell is much softer and more flexible. Though the shell is close enough to the body for blood vessels to be seen through the armor, this protective part of the animal is only attached via a thin membrane along the spinal column of the animal. 
The pink fairy armadillo can curl up to protect the vulnerable soft underside, covered with dense white hair. The armored shell consists of 24 bands that allow the animal to curl up in a ball, and the armor is flattened in the posterior portion of the animal so that it can compress dirt behind it as it is digging. This compression strategy is thought to help prevent tunnel collapses. Lastly, the shell itself is also thought to help with thermoregulation. Since the underlying blood vessels are so close to the surface, the animal can control the amount of functional surface area exposed to the environment in order to retain or lose heat. Like most armadillos, they rely mostly on a sense of smell to find each other and their prey. 
=== Burrowing lifestyle ===
The armadillo has two massive sets of [claws] claws on its front and hind limbs which help it to dig the burrows in compacted soil very quickly. The pink fairy armadillo is nicknamed the ""sand-swimmer"" because it is said that it can ""burrow through the ground as fast as a fish can swim in the sea."" The claws are large relatively to the size of the animal, hindering its ability to walk on a hard surface.
Along with these unique traits, the pink fairy armadillo has greatly reduced eyes and relies highly on touch and hearing to navigate. It also has a torpedo-shaped body in order to reduce the amount of drag it may encounter while working in tunnels and a thick, hairless tail that it uses for balance and stability while using its other limbs to dig.
== Threats ==
As a subterranean dweller, the armadillo is forced to leave its burrows when heavy storms roll in due to the threat of drowning and the risk of wetting its fur. If its fur is wet the armadillo cannot properly thermoregulate and could experience [hypothermia] hypothermia during night hours. Once above ground during a rainstorm the armadillo is vulnerable to an array of predators. Domestic dogs have greatly preyed on these armadillos. Even their underground homes are not completely safe: Fairy armadillos are preyed upon in their burrows by domestic dogs and cats as well as [wild boars] wild boars . 
These armadillos do not do well in captivity. The survival rate is so low that many will die in transport from where they were captured to their new area of captivity. Armadillos that are put into captivity typically do not last longer than a few hours or at most eight days. Not a single specimen has survived more than four years. In spite of the high mortality rate associated with captivity, many are sold illegally on the black market, often as pets. 
Pink fairy armadillos are highly susceptible to changes in climate, habitat loss, farmland pesticide usage, and overhunting. Because they inhabit temperate and warm regions, cold temperatures could wipe out their populations due to their low metabolism rate and inability to store fat. As the number of acres converted to farmland increases, the armadillos' burrows not only get plowed over, but the land is no longer habitable for them. The use of pesticides on farmlands is highly concerning because these pesticides adhere to ants, the armadillos' primary source of food. Ingestion of enough of these pesticide-infested ants can be detrimental to their health. Overhunting is one factor that has definitely contributed to the animals' endangerment. Many people in the Americas continue to hunt armadillos for consumption, which is said to be similar to pork in texture and taste. 
== Conservation efforts ==
In 2006, the armadillo was placed in the [Near-Threatened] Near-Threatened category on the IUCN Red List. In 2008 it was moved to the [Data Deficient] Data Deficient category due to the lack of scientific information on its [population dynamics] population dynamics and [natural history] natural history . Field sightings were confirmed to be rare and less common than before, even though the pink fairy armadillo is already difficult to observe due to its nocturnal fossorial lifestyle. 
Researchers have found that the pink fairy armadillo is highly subject to stress, making the attempts to apply any conservation policies, including taking it out of its natural environment, extremely difficult and largely unsuccessful. Any modifications in its environment, external temperature, or diet are known to trigger stress responses, which is considered to be a possible reason for the failure of captivity attempts. 
Many of the armadillos have died during the transportation process from their wild habitat, and many more have only survived several days in captivity. Overall, there are only three reports of captive maintenance of pink fairy armadillo that are considered successful – in 1970, 1985, and 2009, reporting individuals that lived in captivity for at least 30 months, 22 months, and 8 months respectively. 
This armadillo species is found in several protected areas, including the [Lihué Calel National Park] Lihué Calel National Park . Both national and provincial legislation is in place specifically protecting the species.

Hairy Frog,Hairy frog,"
Astylosternus robustus Astylosternus robustus 
The hairy frog hairy frog ( Trichobatrachus robustus Trichobatrachus robustus Trichobatrachus robustus ) also known as the horror frog horror frog or Wolverine frog Wolverine frog , is a [Central African] Central African species of [frog] frog in the family [Arthroleptidae] Arthroleptidae . It is typically considered [monotypic] monotypic within the genus Trichobatrachus Trichobatrachus Trichobatrachus , but based on its [genetics] genetics , it should be included in Astylosternus [Astylosternus] Astylosternus instead. Its [common name] common name refers to the somewhat hair-like structures on the body and thighs of the breeding male.
== Description ==
Males are about 10–13 cm (4–5 in) long from snout to [vent] vent , while females are 8–11 cm (3–4.5 in). The large head is broad and stubby, with a short rounded snout.
The males have a paired internal vocal sac and three short ridges of small black spines along the inner surface of the first manual digit. Breeding males also develop hair-like [dermal papillae] dermal papillae that extend along the flanks and thighs. These contain [arteries] arteries and are thought to increase the surface area for the purpose of absorbing oxygen (comparably to [external gills] external gills of the aquatic stage), which is useful as the male stays with his eggs for an extended period of time after they have been laid in the water by the female.
The species is [terrestrial] terrestrial , but returns to the water for breeding, where egg masses are laid onto rocks in streams. The quite muscular [tadpoles] tadpoles are [carnivorous] carnivorous and feature several rows of horned teeth. Adults feed on [slugs] slugs , [myriapods] myriapods , [spiders] spiders , [beetles] beetles , and [grasshoppers] grasshoppers .
The hairy frog is also notable in possessing retractable ""claws"", which it may project through the skin, apparently by intentionally breaking the bones of the toe. These are not true [claws] claws , as they are made of bone, not [keratin] keratin . In addition, there is a small bony nodule nestled in the tissue just beyond the frog's fingertip. When sheathed, each claw is anchored to the nodule with tough strands of collagen.  When the frog is grabbed or attacked, it breaks the nodule connection and forces the sharpened bones through the skin. Although a retraction mechanism is not known, it has been hypothesized that the claws later retract passively, while the damaged tissue is [regenerated] regenerated .
This type of natural weaponry appears to be unique in the animal kingdom, although the [Otton frog] Otton frog possesses a similar ""spike"" in its thumb. An alternative hypothesis is that the broken bones could provide a better grip on rocks. 
== Distribution ==
It is found in [Cameroon] Cameroon , [Democratic Republic of the Congo] Democratic Republic of the Congo , [Equatorial Guinea] Equatorial Guinea , [Gabon] Gabon , [Nigeria] Nigeria , and [Angola] Angola , where it inhabits fast-flowing rivers in forests and agricultural lands that retain some cover (for example, plantations). 
== Conservation status ==
T. robustus T. robustus faces [habitat loss] habitat loss , pollution, hunting for food (to lesser extent, also for the wild animal trade), and perhaps [chytridiomycosis] chytridiomycosis . Some populations are decreasing, but it has a large range and is not considered [threatened] threatened overall. 
== Relation with humans ==
This species is roasted and eaten in Cameroon. They are [hunted] hunted with long [spears] spears or [machetes] machetes .
The [Bakossi people] Bakossi people traditionally believed that the frogs fall from the sky and, when eaten, it would help childless couples become fertile.

Chinese Giant Salamander,Chinese giant salamander,"
Megalobatrachus davidianus Megalobatrachus davidianus (Reviewed by Liu, 1950) 
The Chinese giant salamander Chinese giant salamander ( Andrias davidianus Andrias davidianus Andrias davidianus ) is one of the largest [salamanders] salamanders and one of the largest [amphibians] amphibians in the world. It is fully aquatic, and is [endemic] endemic to rocky mountain streams and lakes in the [Yangtze] Yangtze river basin of central [China] China . It has also been [introduced] introduced to [Kyoto Prefecture] Kyoto Prefecture in [Japan] Japan , and possibly to [Taiwan] Taiwan . It is considered [critically endangered] critically endangered in the wild due to [habitat loss] habitat loss , pollution, and overcollection, as it is considered a [delicacy] delicacy and used in [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine . On farms in central China, it is extensively farmed and sometimes bred, although many of the salamanders on the farms are caught in the wild. It has been listed as one of the top-10 ""focal species"" in 2008 by the [Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered] Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project.
The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a "" [living fossil] living fossil "". Although protected under [Chinese law] Chinese law and [CITES] CITES Appendix I, the wild population has declined by more than an estimated 80% since the 1950s. Although traditionally recognized as one of two living species of Andrias [Andrias] Andrias salamander in Asia, the other being the [Japanese giant salamander] Japanese giant salamander , evidence indicates that the Chinese giant salamander may be composed of at least five [cryptic species] cryptic species , further compounding each individual species' endangerment. 
== Taxonomy ==
The correct [scientific name] scientific name of this species has been argued to be Andrias scheuchzeri [Andrias scheuchzeri] Andrias scheuchzeri (in which case Andrias davidianus Andrias davidianus would be a [junior synonym] junior synonym ) – a name otherwise restricted to an [extinct] extinct species described from [Swiss] Swiss fossils. It has also been given the moniker of ""living fossil"" for being part of the family [Cryptobranchidae] Cryptobranchidae which dates back 170 million years. It is one of only five to six known [extant] extant species of the family, the others being the slightly smaller, but otherwise very similar [Japanese giant salamander] Japanese giant salamander ( Andrias japonicus Andrias japonicus ), the slightly larger [South China giant salamander] South China giant salamander ( A. sligoi A. sligoi ), the [Jiangxi giant salamander] Jiangxi giant salamander ( Andrias jiangxiensis Andrias jiangxiensis ), the [Qimen giant salamander] Qimen giant salamander ( Andrias cheni Andrias cheni ), and the far smaller North American [hellbender] hellbender ( Cryptobranchus alleganiensis Cryptobranchus alleganiensis ). 
A 2018 study of [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA revealed that there are five wild [clades] clades of the Chinese giant salamander, as well as two only known from captives (their possible wild range was previously unknown). They diverged from each other 4.71–10.25 million years ago and should possibly be recognized as [cryptic species] cryptic species . Despite this deep divergence, they can [hybridize] hybridize among each other, and also with the Japanese giant salamander. One of these clades was identified in 2019 as Andrias sligoi [Andrias sligoi] Andrias sligoi , a species described in 1924 by [Edward George Boulenger] Edward George Boulenger and later synonymized with A. davidianus A. davidianus , with the study supporting its revival as a distinct taxon. Another then-undescribed species was also identified that formerly inhabited rivers originating from the [Huangshan] Huangshan mountains in eastern China; this was described as Andrias cheni [Andrias cheni] Andrias cheni in 2023. In 2022, one of the captive-only clades was described as Andrias jiangxiensis [Andrias jiangxiensis] Andrias jiangxiensis , and was found to have maintained genetically pure wild populations in [Jiangxi Province] Jiangxi Province , in contrast to most of the other clades. 
== Description ==
It has a large head, small eyes and dark wrinkly skin. Its flat, broad head has a wide mouth, round, lidless eyes, and a line of paired [tubercles] tubercles that run around its head and throat. Its color is typically dark brown with a mottled or speckled pattern, but it can also be other brownish tones, dark reddish, or black. [Albinos] Albinos , which are white or orange, have been recorded. All species of giant salamanders produce a sticky, white skin secretion that repels predators. 
The average adult salamander weighs 25–30 kg (55–66 lb) and is 1.15 m (3.8 ft) in length. It can reach up to 50 kg (110 lb) in weight and 1.8 m (5.9 ft) in length, making it the second-largest amphibian species, after the [South China giant salamander] South China giant salamander ( Andrias sligoi Andrias sligoi ). The longest recently documented Chinese giant salamander, kept at a farm in [Zhangjiajie] Zhangjiajie , was 1.8 m (5.9 ft) in 2007. At 59 kg (130 lb), both this individual, and a 1.4 m (4.6 ft) long, 52 kg (114 lb) individual found in a remote cave in [Chongqing] Chongqing in December 2015, surpassed the species' typically reported maximum weight. 
The giant salamander is known to vocalize, making barking, whining, hissing, or crying sounds. Some of these vocalizations bear a striking resemblance to the crying of a young human child, and as such, it is known in the [Chinese language] Chinese language as the ""infant fish"" (娃娃鱼 / 鲵 - Wáwáyú/ ní). 
== Behavior ==
=== Diet ===
The Chinese giant salamander has been recorded feeding on insects, [millipedes] millipedes , [horsehair worms] horsehair worms , amphibians (both frogs and salamanders), [freshwater crabs] freshwater crabs , shrimp, fish (such as Saurogobio [Saurogobio] Saurogobio and Cobitis [Cobitis] Cobitis ), and [Asiatic water shrew] Asiatic water shrew . Presumably ingested by mistake, plant material and gravel have also been found in their stomachs. [Cannibalism] Cannibalism is frequent; in a study of 79 specimens from the [Qinling] Qinling – [Dabashan] Dabashan range, the stomach content of five included remains of other Chinese giant salamanders and this made up 28% of the combined weight of all food items in the study. The most frequent items in the same study were freshwater crabs (found in 19 specimens), which made up 23% of the combined weight of all food items. 
It has very poor eyesight, so it depends on special sensory nodes that run in a line on the body from head to tail. It is capable of sensing the slightest vibrations around it with the help of these nodes. Based on a captive study, most activity is from the earlier evening to the early night. Most individuals stop feeding at water temperatures above 20 °C (68 °F) and feeding ceases almost entirely at 28 °C (82 °F). Temperatures of 35 °C (95 °F) are lethal to Chinese giant salamanders. 
Adult Chinese giant salamanders and maturing Chinese giant salamanders with nonexistent or shrinking [gill slits] gill slits have developed a system for bidirectional flow suction feeding under water. They start by moving to their prey very slowly, then once close enough to them the Chinese giant salamander abruptly gapes its mouth open. The gaping motion of their mouth causes a great increase in the velocity of the water straight ahead of them compared to water coming in from the sides of their mouth. This is possible because of their large, wide, and flat upper and lower jaws. This process causes the prey to shoot back into their mouths as well as a copious amount of water. They then close their mouths, but leave a small gap between their upper and lower lips so that the captured water can escape. 
The Chinese giant salamander catches its prey on land with an asymmetrical bite, in such a way that the force created by their jaws will be maximized in the anterior region where their prey is located. After capture they use their bite to subdue and kill their prey, both on land and in water. They are missing a bone which usually lies along the upper cheek region of most salamanders, which gives them a much stronger bite force. The bite force of the adult Chinese giant salamander is much stronger than the bite force of the maturing Chinese giant salamander due to differences in cranial structure. 
Chinese giant salamanders [esophaguses] esophaguses are made up of four different layers, one of which being a strong muscular tissue used to help move food through to the stomach. The outer most layer has [ciliated cells] ciliated cells that move mucous from mucous glands over the surface of the esophagus to lubricate it and reduce friction from large foods such as whole crabs. The ciliated structure and flexibility of the Chinese giant salamander's esophagus is hypothesized to be the reason why it is capable of swallowing such large foods. 
Chinese giant salamanders are also capable of fasting for several years if they need to. This is possible because of their metabolic reserves as well as their liver, which is capable of up regulating and down regulating certain proteins according to how long they have been fasting for. 
=== Breeding and lifecycle ===
Both sexes maintain a [territory] territory , averaging 40 m (1,400 cu ft) for males and 30 m (1,100 cu ft) for females. The reproductive cycle is initiated when the water temperature reaches 20 °C (68 °F) and mating occurs between July and September. The female lays 400–500 eggs in an underwater breeding cavity, which is guarded by the male until the eggs hatch after 50–60 days. They have a variety of different courtship displays including knocking bellies, leaning side-to-side, riding, mouth-to-mouth posturing, chasing, rolling over, inviting, and cohabiting. When laid, the eggs measure 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) in diameter, but they increase to about double that size by absorbing water. When hatching, the larvae are about 3 cm (1.2 in) long and [external gills] external gills remain until a length of about 20 cm (8 in) at an age of 3 years. The external gills start to slowly decrease in size around 9 to 16 months, the rate of this phenomenon occurs in relation to the rate of dissolved oxygen, breeding density, water temperatures, and individual differences. Maturity is reached at an age of 5 to 6 years and a length of 40–50 cm (16–20 in). The maximum age reached by Chinese giant salamanders is unknown, but it is at least 60 years based on captive individuals. Undocumented claims have been made of 200-year-old Chinese giant salamanders, but these are considered unreliable. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Chinese giant salamander [species complex] species complex comprises five clades, with multiple possibly worthy of species recognition. Their native ranges differ, but release of Chinese giant salamanders from captivity has complicated this picture. They were widespread in central, south-western, and southern China, although their range is now highly fragmented. Their range spans the area from [Qinghai] Qinghai east to [Jiangsu] Jiangsu and south to [Sichuan] Sichuan , [Guangxi] Guangxi , and [Guangdong] Guangdong ; notably in the [basins] basins of the [Yangtze] Yangtze , [Yellow] Yellow , and [Pearl Rivers] Pearl Rivers . One clade is from the Pearl River basin (at least in Guangxi), two from the Yellow River basin, one from the Yangtze River basin (at least in [Chongqing] Chongqing and [Guizhou] Guizhou ), and the final from the [Qiantang River] Qiantang River (at least in [Anhui] Anhui ). Two additional clades were only known from captivity (their wild range is unknown) and no samples are available for the population in the [Tibetan Plateau] Tibetan Plateau . A 2019 study has identified that the Yangtze River clade comprises the ""true"" A. davidianus A. davidianus , the Pearl River clade comprises A. sligoi A. sligoi , and the Qiantang clade comprises the Huangshan Mountains species (described as A. cheni A. cheni in 2023). A 2022 study identified one of the two clades known only from captivity as A. jiangxiensis A. jiangxiensis , found in the wild only in [Jiangxi Province] Jiangxi Province .
Finds in [Taiwan] Taiwan may be the result of [introduction] introduction , though their exact taxonomic identity is unknown. Chinese giant salamanders have been introduced to the [Kyoto Prefecture] Kyoto Prefecture in Japan where they present a threat to the native [Japanese giant salamander] Japanese giant salamander , as the two hybridize. A 2024 genetic study confirmed that in spite of the recent taxonomic changes within the genus, the Chinese Andrias Andrias species introduced to Japan and hybridizing with A. japonicus A. japonicus is the ""true"" A. davidianus A. davidianus (the Yangtze River clade, or lineage B), although at least one genetically pure individual of the captive-only lineage U1 was also detected in the wild. The Chinese giant salamander is entirely aquatic and lives in rocky hill streams and lakes with clear water. It typically lives in dark, muddy, or rocky crevices along the banks. It is usually found in forested regions at altitudes of 100 to 1,500 m (300 to 4,900 ft), with most records between 300 and 800 m (1,000 and 2,600 ft). There is an isolated population at an altitude of 4,200 m (13,800 ft) in Qinghai (Tibetan Plateau), but its [taxonomic] taxonomic position is uncertain and the site likely does not support giant salamanders anymore due to pollution. 
The salamanders prefer to live in streams of small width (on average, 6.39 m or 21 ft across), quick flow, and little depth (on average, 1.07 m or 3 ft 6 in deep). Water temperature varies depending on season, with typical range at low elevation sites being from 10 to 25 °C (50 to 77 °F) and at high elevation sites from 3 to 20 °C (37 to 68 °F). Although they prefer to have quick flow in the stream, the burrows in which they lay their eggs often have much slower flow. Furthermore, their habitat often possesses very rocky, irregular stream beds with a lot of gravel and small rocks as well as some vegetation. Chinese giant salamanders are also known from [subterranean rivers] subterranean rivers . As populations in aboveground rivers and lakes are more vulnerable to [poaching] poaching , there are some parts of China where only the subterranean populations remain. 
== In captivity ==
=== Farming ===
Very large numbers are being [farmed] farmed in China, but most of the [breeding stock] breeding stock are either wild-caught or first-generation captive-bred. This is partially explained by the fact that the industry is relatively new, but some farms have also struggled to produce second-generation captive-bred offspring. Registrations showed that 2.6 million Chinese giant salamanders were kept in farms in 2011 in [Shaanxi] Shaanxi alone, far surpassing the entire countrywide wild population estimated at less than 50,000 individuals. Shaanxi farms (mainly in the [Qinling Mountain] Qinling Mountain region) accounted for about 70% of the total output in China in 2012, but there are also many farms in [Guizhou] Guizhou and several in other provinces. Among 43 south Shaanxi farms surveyed, 38 bred the species in 2010 and each produced an average of c. 10,300 larvae that year. Farming of Chinese giant salamanders, [herbs] herbs , and [mushrooms] mushrooms are the three most important economic activities in Shaanxi's Qinling Mountain region, and many thousands of families rely on the giant salamander farms for income. The giant salamander farming mainly supplies the food market, but whether this can be achieved to an extent where the pressure on the wild populations is reduced is doubtful. Release of captive-bred Chinese giant salamanders is supported by the government (8,000 were released in Shaanxi in 2011 alone), but represent a potential risk to the remaining wild population, as diseases such as Ranavirus [Ranavirus] Ranavirus are known from many farms. The vast majority of the farmed Chinese giant salamanders, almost 80% based on a study published in 2018, are of Yellow River origin (the so-called [haplotype] haplotype B), although those from other regions also occur. Farms have generally not considered this issue when releasing giant salamanders and Yellow River animals now dominate in some regions outside their original range, further endangering the native types. Additionally, release of untreated [wastewater] wastewater from farms may spread diseases to wild Chinese giant salamanders. 
=== In zoos and aquariums ===
As of early 2008, [Species360] Species360 records show only five individuals held in US zoos ( [Zoo Atlanta] Zoo Atlanta , [Cincinnati Zoo] Cincinnati Zoo , and [Saint Louis Zoological Park] Saint Louis Zoological Park ), and an additional four in European zoos ( [Dresden Zoo] Dresden Zoo and [Rotterdam Zoo] Rotterdam Zoo ); as well as one in the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe, where it is also the museum's mascot. 
As of 2019, [London Zoo] London Zoo holds four individuals (one of them on display) that were seized from an illegal importation of amphibians in 2016. A medium-sized individual, approximately 0.9 m (3 ft) long, was kept for several years at the [Steinhart Aquarium] Steinhart Aquarium in [San Francisco] San Francisco , [California] California , and is now on display again in the ""Water Planet"" section of the new [California Academy of Sciences] California Academy of Sciences building. There are also two in residence at the [Los Angeles Zoo] Los Angeles Zoo . Additional individuals are likely kept in non- [Species360] Species360 zoos and animals parks in its native China, such as [Shanghai Zoo] Shanghai Zoo . Several of them are kept in the aquaria of [Shanghai] Shanghai and [Xi'an] Xi'an . The [Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan] Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan in Japan has both a Chinese and a Japanese giant salamander on display, as does the [Saitama aquarium] Saitama aquarium in [Hanyū, Saitama] Hanyū, Saitama . The [Ueno Zoological Gardens] Ueno Zoological Gardens also has a Chinese giant salamander on display.
Since May 2014, 33 Chinese giant salamanders, including three adults, have been held in [Prague Zoo] Prague Zoo . The main attraction is the largest individual in Europe, which is 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) long. 
== Decline in population ==
In the past, the Chinese giant salamander was fairly common and widespread in China. Since the 1950s, the population has declined rapidly due to habitat destruction and overhunting. It has been listed as [Critically Endangered] Critically Endangered in the Chinese Red Book of Amphibians and Reptiles Chinese Red Book of Amphibians and Reptiles . Despite the Chinese Government listing the salamander as a Class II Protected Species, 100 salamanders are hunted illegally every year in the Hupingshan Natural Nature Reserve alone. Since the 1980s, 14 [nature reserves] nature reserves have been established as an effort to conserve the species. Despite this, the population continues to decline with the salamanders becoming increasingly difficult to find. In a recent survey of the species in the Qinghai Province, none were found indicating the population size is at a significantly low number or the species is locally extinct in the province. This is believed to be due to the increased [mining] mining in the region. 
In recent years populations have also declined with an [epizootic] epizootic  Ranavirus [Ranavirus] Ranavirus infection. The disease causes severe [hemorrhaging] hemorrhaging in both juveniles and adult salamanders. The virus was named the Chinese giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV). 
Its natural range has suffered in the past few decades due to habitat loss and [overharvesting] overharvesting . Consequently, many salamanders are now farmed in [mesocosms] mesocosms across China. Furthermore, previously built concrete dams that destroyed the salamander's habitat are now fitted with stairs so that the animal can easily navigate the dam and make it back to its niche. 
The Chinese giant salamander is listed as a critically endangered species. It has experienced a drastic population decline, which is estimated to be more than 80% in the last 3 generations and due to human causes. Human consumption is the main threat to the Chinese giant salamander. They are considered to be a luxury food item and source of traditional medicines in China.
=== Habitat destruction ===
According to a recent study, 90% of the Chinese giant salamanders' habitat was destroyed by the year 2000, and there are many human-related causes of such massive destruction. Because the salamander dwells in free-flowing streams, [industrialization] industrialization is a large problem for many stream-dwelling species. The construction of [dams] dams greatly disturbs their habitat by either causing these streams to dry up or to stand still, thus making it uninhabitable by the salamanders.  [Siltation] Siltation also contributes to the degradation of their habitats by soiling the water.  [Deforestation] Deforestation in areas near the streams can worsen [soil erosion] soil erosion and create [runoff] runoff into the streams as well, which reduces the water quality to a great extent. The reduced water quality makes it much more difficult for the salamanders to absorb [oxygen] oxygen through their skin and can often bring death to those within the species. 
[Water pollution] Water pollution is also a great factor in the [habitat destruction] habitat destruction of the Chinese giant salamander; the immense decline in their population can be traced to, among the other major problems of over-hunting and failed conservation efforts, the tainting of the water that they live in. Mining activity in particular in areas near their streams often causes runoff that sullies the water, and farming—and all of the pesticides and chemicals that affect the soil that come with it—has a vastly negative effect on the areas near the streams as well. The presence of [macronutrients] macronutrients in the streams can also cause [algal blooms] algal blooms , which cloud the water and force the temperature to rise. The salamanders reside primarily in very cold underwater cavities and follow a specific nesting requirement, which means that they will only reproduce and care for their eggs in areas such as these, so changes in temperature are incredibly detrimental to their health and well-being as well as to their perpetuation as a species. These algal blooms also deplete the levels of oxygen in the water, and a lesser supply of oxygen can quite easily hold the potential to kill off many members of the dwindling species. 
Many efforts have been undertaken to create reserves and faux habitats for the Chinese giant salamander so that they can reproduce without worry of soiled water, but many of these reserves have failed in having a great impact overall due to the massive overhunting of the species. No matter how many members of the species they manage to save through the reserves, the poachers still manage to capture and kill that many more. Although habitat destruction is certainly not assisting in the perpetuation of the species, it is certainly not the biggest obstacle that the Chinese giant salamander faces in its quest to avoid extinction. 
=== Climate change ===
Like other amphibians, the Chinese giant salamander is [ectothermic] ectothermic . Most Chinese giant salamanders stop feeding at water temperatures above 20 °C (68 °F) and feeding ceases almost entirely at 28 °C (82 °F). Temperatures of 35 °C (95 °F) are lethal to Chinese giant salamanders. As a consequence, the species is vulnerable to [global warming] global warming . 
=== Overhunting ===
One of the main reasons that the Chinese giant salamander, Andrias davidianus Andrias davidianus , has been placed on the critically endangered list by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature is overhunting. 75% of native species in China are harvested for food. The salamander is also used for traditional medicinal purposes. In 1989, the Chinese government placed legal protection on the salamander (category II due to its population decline by The Wild Animal Protection Law of China and Appendix I in the Convention of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna. ).
But the salamander populations have continued to decline. The domestic demand for salamander meat and body parts greatly exceeds what can sustainably be harvested from the wild. Commercial captive breeding operations so far still rely on the regular introduction of new wild-caught breeding adults, because captive-bred animals have proven difficult to mate. In addition, salamander farms would need to increase their yield manifold before the black-market price of poached salamander drop significantly, meaning that a stricter enforcement of anti-poaching law is still very much the future for the Chinese giant salamander.
China's penalty for illegally hunting these creatures is very low and only comes to 50 [yuan] yuan , or about US$6, which is less than one hundred times the black-market price. Establishments such as restaurants can charge up to US$250–US$400 per kilogram.
A hunting tool known as a [bow hook] bow hook is one of the preferred methods used by hunters to catch the salamander. This hunting tool is made with a combination of [bamboo] bamboo and sharp hooks baited with frogs or smaller fish. This is used to capture the salamander and keep it alive. Some hunters use [pesticides] pesticides to kill the salamander. Farmers often poach wild salamanders to stock their breeding programs, while others are hunted as food.
In a 2018 study, the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London and the [Kunming Institute of Zoology in China] Kunming Institute of Zoology in China reported on their surveys for giant salamanders in 16 Chinese provinces over four years. The researchers had been unable to confirm survival of wild salamanders at any of the 97 sites they surveyed. The study also brought up worries that commercial farms and conservation programs were [crossbreeding] crossbreeding what they described as five distinct species of Chinese giant salamanders. All the wild populations studied were found ""critically depleted or extirpated"" by the study. A related study found that some of the five distinct genetic lineages were probably already extinct in the wild. However, the exhaustiveness of these surveys was questioned in a 2022 study by Chai et al et al ., who noted that over a third of the surveys had been performed only in [Guizhou Province] Guizhou Province , and another third of the surveys had been performed in provinces that were only selected by habitat suitability modeling and had no actual historic records of giant salamanders. Based on this, the extent of extirpation of Chinese Andrias Andrias remains uncertain, especially as a natural population of Andrias jiangxiensis [Andrias jiangxiensis] Andrias jiangxiensis was discovered during the Chai et al. et al. study.

Tuatara,Tuatara,"

The tuatara tuatara ( Sphenodon punctatus Sphenodon punctatus Sphenodon punctatus ) is a species of [reptile] reptile  [endemic] endemic to [New Zealand] New Zealand . Despite its close resemblance to [lizards] lizards , it is part of a distinct lineage, the order [Rhynchocephalia] Rhynchocephalia . The name tuatara tuatara tuatara is derived from the [Māori language] Māori language and means ""peaks on the back"". 
The single extant [species] species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which was highly diverse during the [Mesozoic] Mesozoic era. Rhynchocephalians first appeared in the fossil record during the [Triassic] Triassic , around 240 million years ago, and reached worldwide distribution and peak diversity during the [Jurassic] Jurassic , when they represented the world's dominant group of small reptiles. Rhynchocephalians declined during the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous , with their youngest records outside New Zealand dating to the [Paleocene] Paleocene . Their closest living relatives are [squamates] squamates (lizards and [snakes] snakes ). Tuatara are of interest for studying the evolution of reptiles.
Tuatara are greenish brown and grey, and measure up to 80 cm (31 in) from head to tail-tip and weigh up to 1.3 kg (2.9 lb) with a spiny crest along the back, especially pronounced in males. They have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlapping one row on the lower jaw, which is unique among living species. They are able to hear, although no external ear is present, and have unique features in their skeleton.
Tuatara are sometimes referred to as "" [living fossils] living fossils "" . This term is currently [deprecated] deprecated among paleontologists and evolutionary biologists. Although tuatara have preserved the morphological characteristics of their Mesozoic ancestors (240–230 million years ago), there is no evidence of a continuous fossil record to support the idea that the species has survived unchanged since that time. 
The species has between 5 and 6 billion [base pairs] base pairs of [DNA sequence] DNA sequence , nearly twice that of humans. 
The tuatara ( Sphenodon punctatus Sphenodon punctatus ) has been protected by law since 1895. Tuatara, like many of New Zealand's native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators, such as the [Polynesian rat] Polynesian rat  (Rattus exulans) (Rattus exulans) . Tuatara were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands, until the first North Island release into the heavily fenced and monitored [Karori Wildlife Sanctuary] Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (now named ""Zealandia"") in 2005. During routine maintenance work at [Zealandia] Zealandia in late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered, with a hatchling found the following autumn. This is thought to be the first case of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on New Zealand's North Island in over 200 years.

[Aves] Aves (birds)
Tuatara, along with other now-extinct members of the order [Rhynchocephalia] Rhynchocephalia , belong to the superorder [Lepidosauria] Lepidosauria , as do the order [Squamata] Squamata , which includes lizards and snakes. Squamates and tuatara both show [caudal autotomy] caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse [cloacal] cloacal slits. 
Tuatara were originally classified as lizards in 1831 when the [British Museum] British Museum received a skull. [John Edward Gray] John Edward Gray used the name Sphenodon Sphenodon to describe the skull; this remains the current scientific name for the genus.  Sphenodon Sphenodon is derived from the [Greek] Greek for ""wedge"" (σφήν, σφηνός/ sphenos sphenos ) and ""tooth"" (ὀδούς, ὀδόντος/ odontos odontos ). In 1842, Grey described a member of the species as Hatteria punctata Hatteria punctata , not realising that it and the skull he received in 1831 were both tuatara. 
The genus remained misclassified as a lizard until 1867, when [A.C.L.G. Günther] A.C.L.G. Günther of the British Museum noted features similar to birds, turtles, and crocodiles. He proposed the order Rhynchocephalia (meaning ""beak head"") for the tuatara and its fossil relatives. Since 1869, Sphenodon punctatus Sphenodon punctatus (or the variation Sphenodon punctatum Sphenodon punctatum in some earlier sources) has been used as the scientific name for the species. 
At one point, many disparate species were incorrectly referred to the Rhynchocephalia, resulting in what taxonomists call a "" [wastebasket taxon] wastebasket taxon "".  [Williston] Williston in 1925 proposed the Sphenodontia to include only tuatara and their closest fossil relatives. However, Rhynchocephalia is the older name and in widespread use today. Many scholars use Sphenodontia as a subset of Rhynchocephalia, including almost all members of Rhynchocephalia, apart from the most primitive representatives of the group. 
The earliest rhynchocephalian, Wirtembergia [Wirtembergia] Wirtembergia , is known from the [Middle Triassic] Middle Triassic of Germany, around 240 million years ago. During the [Late Triassic] Late Triassic , rhynchocephalians greatly diversified, going on to become the world's dominant group of small reptiles during the [Jurassic] Jurassic period, when the group was represented by a diversity of forms, including the aquatic [pleurosaurs] pleurosaurs and the herbivorous [eilenodontines] eilenodontines . The earliest members of [Sphenodontinae] Sphenodontinae , the clade which includes the tuatara, are known from the [Early Jurassic] Early Jurassic of North America. The earliest representatives of this group are already very similar to the modern tuatara. Rhynchocephalians declined during the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous period, possibly due to competition with mammals and lizards, with their youngest record outside of New Zealand being of Kawasphenodon [Kawasphenodon] Kawasphenodon , known from the [Paleocene] Paleocene of Patagonia in South America. 
A species of sphenodontine is known from the [Miocene] Miocene  [Saint Bathans fauna] Saint Bathans fauna from [Otago] Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. Whether it is referable to Sphenodon Sphenodon proper is not entirely clear, but it is likely to be closely related to tuatara. The ancestors of the tuatara were likely already present in New Zealand prior to its separation from Antarctica around 82–60 million years ago.

=== Species ===
While there is currently considered to be only one living species of tuatara, two species were previously identified: Sphenodon punctatus Sphenodon punctatus , or northern tuatara, and the much rarer Sphenodon guntheri Sphenodon guntheri , or Brothers Island tuatara, which is confined to [North Brother Island] North Brother Island in the [Cook Strait] Cook Strait . The [specific name] specific name  punctatus punctatus is [Latin] Latin for ""spotted"", and guntheri guntheri refers to [German] German -born [British] British  [herpetologist] herpetologist  [Albert Günther] Albert Günther . A 2009 paper re-examined the genetic bases used to distinguish the two supposed species of tuatara, and concluded they only represent geographic variants, and only one species should be recognized. Consequently, the northern tuatara was re-classified as Sphenodon punctatus punctatus Sphenodon punctatus punctatus and the Brothers Island tuatara as Sphenodon punctatus guntheri Sphenodon punctatus guntheri . The Brothers Island tuatara has olive brown skin with yellowish patches, while the colour of the northern tuatara ranges from olive green through grey to dark pink or brick red, often mottled, and always with white spots. In addition, the Brothers Island tuatara is considerably smaller. However. ondividuals from Brothers Island could not be distinguished from other modern and fossil samples on the basis of jaw morphology. 
An extinct species of Sphenodon Sphenodon was identified in November 1885 by William Colenso, who was sent an incomplete [subfossil] subfossil specimen from a local coal mine. Colenso named the new species S. diversum S. diversum . Fawcett and Smith (1970) consider it a synonym to the subspecies, based on a lack of distinction. 
== Description ==
Tuatara are the largest reptiles in New Zealand. Adult S. punctatus S. punctatus males measure 61 cm (24 in) in length and females 45 cm (18 in). Tuatara are [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic , males being larger. The [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo even cites a length of up to 80 cm (31 in). Males weigh up to 1 kg (2.2 lb), and females up to 0.5 kg (1.1 lb). Brothers Island tuatara are slightly smaller, weighing up to 660 g (1.3 lb). 
Their lungs have a single chamber with no [bronchi] bronchi . 
The tuatara's greenish brown colour matches its environment, and can change over its lifetime. Tuatara shed their skin at least once per year as adults, and three or four times a year as juveniles. Tuatara sexes differ in more than size. The spiny crest on a tuatara's back, made of triangular, soft folds of skin, is larger in males, and can be stiffened for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the female's. 
=== Skull ===
Unlike the vast majority of lizards, the tuatara has a complete lower temporal bar closing the lower [temporal fenestra] temporal fenestra (an opening of the skull behind the eye socket), caused by the fusion of the [quadrate] quadrate / [quadratojugal] quadratojugal (which are fused into a single element in adult tuatara) and the [jugal bones] jugal bones of the skull. This is similar to the condition found in primitive [diapsid] diapsid reptiles. However, because more primitive rhynchocephalians have an open lower temporal fenestra with an incomplete temporal bar, this is thought to be [derived] derived characteristic of the tuatara and other members of the clade [Sphenodontinae] Sphenodontinae , rather than a primitive trait retained from early diapsids. The complete bar is thought to stabilise the skull during biting. 
The tip of the upper jaw is chisel- or beak-like and separated from the remainder of the jaw by a notch, this structure is formed from fused [premaxillary] premaxillary teeth, and is also found in many other advanced rhynchocephalians. The teeth of the tuatara, and almost all other rhynchocephalians, are described as [acrodont] acrodont , as they are attached to the apex of the jaw bone. This contrast with the [pleurodont] pleurodont condition found in the vast majority of lizards, where the teeth are attached to the inward-facing surface of the jaw. The teeth of the tuatara are extensively fused to the jawbone, making the boundary between the tooth and jaw difficult to discern, and the teeth lack roots and are not replaced during the lifetime of the animal, unlike those of pleurodont lizards. It is a common misconception that tuatara lack teeth and instead have sharp projections on the jaw bone; histology shows that they have true teeth with enamel and dentine with pulp cavities. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as [earthworms] earthworms , [larvae] larvae , and [slugs] slugs , and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones. 
The tuatara possesses palatal dentition (teeth growing from the bones of the roof of the mouth), which is ancestrally present in reptiles (and [tetrapods] tetrapods generally). While many of the original palatal teeth present in reptiles have been lost, as in all other known rhynchocephalians, the row of teeth growing from the [palatine bones] palatine bones in the tuatara have been enlarged, and as in other members of Sphenodontinae the palatine teeth are orientated parallel to the teeth in the [maxilla] maxilla ; during biting the teeth of the lower jaw slot between the two upper tooth rows. The structure of the jaw joint allows the lower jaw to slide forwards after it has closed between the two upper rows of teeth. This mechanism allows the jaws to shear through [chitin] chitin and bone. 
The brain of Sphenodon Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its [endocranium] endocranium . This proportion has been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume in the endocranium. 
=== Sensory organs ===
The eyes can [focus] focus independently, and are specialised with three types of photoreceptive cells, all with fine structural characteristics of retinal [cone cells] cone cells used for both day and night vision, and a tapetum lucidum [tapetum lucidum] tapetum lucidum which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the [nictitating membrane] nictitating membrane . Five visual [opsin] opsin genes are present, suggesting good [colour vision] colour vision , possibly even at low light levels. 
Like some other living vertebrates, including some lizards, the tuatara has a third eye on the top of its head called the [parietal eye] parietal eye (also called a pineal or third eye) formed by the parapineal organ, with an accompanying opening in the skull roof called the pineal or parietal foramen, enclosed by the [parietal bones] parietal bones . It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a [cornea] cornea ,  [retina] retina with rod-like structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is visible only in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. While capable of detecting light, it is probably not capable of detecting movement or forming an image. It likely serves to regulate the [circadian rhythm] circadian rhythm and possibly detect seasonal changes, and help with [thermoregulation] thermoregulation . 
Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the [pineal gland] pineal gland , which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some [salamanders] salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding [navigation] navigation . 
Together with [turtles] turtles , the tuatara has the most primitive hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no tympanum ( [eardrum] eardrum ) and no earhole, and the [middle ear] middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly [adipose (fatty) tissue] adipose (fatty) tissue . The [stapes] stapes comes into contact with the [quadrate] quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the [hyoid] hyoid and [squamosal] squamosal . The [hair cells] hair cells are unspecialised, innervated by both [afferent] afferent and [efferent nerve] efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800 [Hz] Hz , with peak sensitivity of 40 [dB] dB at 200 Hz. 
Animals that depend on the sense of smell to capture prey, escape from predators or simply interact with the environment they inhabit, usually have many odorant receptors. These receptors are expressed in the dendritic membranes of the neurons for the detection of odours. The tuatara has around 472 receptors, a number more similar to what birds have than to the large number of receptors that turtles and crocodiles may have. 
=== Spine and ribs ===
The tuatara [spine] spine is made up of hourglass-shaped [amphicoelous] amphicoelous vertebrae, concave both before and behind. This is the usual condition of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to tuatara within the amniotes. The vertebral bodies have a tiny hole through which a constricted remnant of the notochord passes; this was typical in early fossil reptiles, but lost in most other amniotes. 
The tuatara has [gastralia] gastralia , rib-like bones also called gastric or abdominal ribs, the presumed ancestral trait of diapsids. They are found in some [lizards] lizards , where they are mostly made of cartilage, as well as crocodiles and the tuatara, and are not attached to the spine or thoracic ribs. The true ribs are small projections, with small, hooked bones, called uncinate processes, found on the rear of each rib. This feature is also present in birds. The tuatara is the only living [tetrapod] tetrapod with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.
In the early tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, together with bony elements such as bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and [clavicles] clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia may have been involved in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales. 
=== Tail and back ===
The spiny plates on the back and tail of the tuatara resemble those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it. The regrowth takes a long time and differs from that of lizards. Well illustrated reports on tail regeneration in tuatara have been published by Alibardi and Meyer-Rochow. The cloacal glands of tuatara have a unique [organic compound] organic compound named [tuataric acid] tuataric acid .
=== Age determination ===
Currently, there are two means of determining the age of tuatara. Using microscopic inspection, hematoxylinophilic rings can be identified and counted in both the phalanges and the femur. Phalangeal hematoxylinophilic rings can be used for tuatara up to ages 12–14 years, as they cease to form around this age. Femoral rings follow a similar trend, however they are useful for tuatara up to ages 25–35 years. Around that age, femoral rings cease to form. Further research on age determination methods for tuatara is required, as tuatara have lifespans much longer than 35 years (ages up to 60 are common, and captive tuatara have lived to over 100 years). One possibility could be via examination of tooth wear, as tuatara have fused sets of teeth.
=== Physiology ===
Adult tuatara are [terrestrial] terrestrial and [nocturnal] nocturnal reptiles, though they will often bask in the sun to warm their bodies. Hatchlings hide under logs and stones, and are [diurnal] diurnal , likely because adults are cannibalistic. Juveniles are typically active at night, but can be found active during the day. The juveniles' movement pattern is attributed to genetic hardwire of conspecifics for predator avoidance and thermal restrictions. Tuatara thrive in temperatures much lower than those tolerated by most reptiles, and [hibernate] hibernate during winter. They remain active at temperatures as low as 5 °C (41 °F), while temperatures over 28 °C (82 °F) are generally fatal. The optimal body temperature for the tuatara is from 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70 °F), the lowest of any reptile. The body temperature of tuatara is lower than that of other reptiles, ranging from 5.2–11.2 °C (41.4–52.2 °F) over a day, whereas most reptiles have body temperatures around 20 °C (68 °F). The low body temperature results in a slower [metabolism] metabolism .
== Ecology ==
Burrowing seabirds such as [petrels] petrels , [prions] prions , and [shearwaters] shearwaters share the tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the [birds] birds ' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' [guano] guano helps to maintain invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey, including [beetles] beetles , [crickets] crickets , [spiders] spiders , [wētās] wētās , [earthworms] earthworms , and [snails] snails . Their diets also consist of [frogs] frogs , [lizards] lizards , and bird's eggs and chicks. Young tuatara are also occasionally cannibalized. The diet of the tuatara varies seasonally, and they consume mainly [fairy prions] fairy prions and their eggs in the summer. In total darkness no feeding attempt was observed , and the lowest light intensity at which an attempt to snatch a beetle was observed occurred under 0.0125 [lux] lux . The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide [beneficial fatty acids] beneficial fatty acids . Tuatara of both sexes defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily. Female tuatara rarely exhibit parental behaviour by guarding nests on islands with high rodent populations. 
Tuataras are parasitised by the [tuatara tick] tuatara tick ( Archaeocroton sphenodonti Archaeocroton sphenodonti ), a [tick] tick that directly depends on tuataras. These ticks tend to be more prevalent on larger males, as they have larger home ranges than smaller and female tuatara and interact with other tuatara more in territorial displays. 
== Reproduction ==
Tuatara reproduce very slowly, taking 10 to 20 years to reach sexual maturity. Though their reproduction rate is slow, tuatara have the fastest swimming sperm by two to four times compared to all reptiles studied earlier. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay [eggs] eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs. The female will either allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males do not have a penis; they have rudimentary [hemipenes] hemipenes ; meaning that [intromittent organs] intromittent organs are used to deliver sperm to the female during copulation. They reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his [vent] vent over hers. This process is sometimes referred to as a ""cloacal kiss"". The [sperm] sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds. Along with birds, the tuatara is one of the few members of [Amniota] Amniota to have lost the ancestral penis. 
Tuatara eggs have a soft, parchment-like 0.2 mm thick shell that consists of calcite crystals embedded in a matrix of fibrous layers. It takes the females between one and three years to provide eggs with yolk, and up to seven months to form the shell. It then takes between 12 and 15 months from copulation to hatching. This means reproduction occurs at two- to five-year intervals, the slowest in any reptile. Survival of embryos has also been linked to having more success in moist conditions. Wild tuatara are known to be still reproducing at about 60 years of age; ""Henry"", a male tuatara at Southland Museum in [Invercargill] Invercargill , New Zealand, became a father (possibly for the first time) on 23 January 2009, at age 111, with an 80 year-old female. 
The sex of a hatchling [depends on the temperature] depends on the temperature of the egg, with warmer eggs tending to produce male tuatara, and cooler eggs producing females. Eggs incubated at 21 °C (70 °F) have an equal chance of being male or female. However, at 22 °C (72 °F), 80% are likely to be males, and at 20 °C (68 °F), 80% are likely to be females; at 18 °C (64 °F) all hatchlings will be females. Some evidence indicates sex determination in tuatara is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. 
Tuatara probably have the slowest growth rates of any reptile, continuing to grow larger for the first 35 years of their lives. The average lifespan is about 60 years, but they can live to be well over 100 years old; tuatara could be the reptile with the second longest lifespan after tortoises. Some experts believe that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years. This may be related to genes that offer protection against reactive oxygen species. The tuatara genome has 26 genes that encode [selenoproteins] selenoproteins and 4 [selenocysteine] selenocysteine -specific [tRNA] tRNA genes. In humans, selenoproteins have a function of antioxidation, redox regulation and synthesis of thyroid hormones. It is not fully demonstrated, but these genes may be related to the longevity of this animal or may have emerged as a result of the low levels of selenium and other trace elements in the New Zealand terrestrial systems. 
== Genomic characteristics ==
The most abundant [LINE element] LINE element in the tuatara is L2 (10%). Most of them are interspersed and can remain active. The longest L2 element found is 4 kb long and 83% of the sequences had ORF2p completely intact. The CR1 element is the second most repeated (4%). Phylogenetic analysis shows that these sequences are very different from those found in other nearby species such as lizards. Finally, less than 1% are elements belonging to L1, a low percentage since these elements tend to predominate in placental mammals. Usually, the predominant LINE elements are the CR1, contrary to what has been seen in the tuatara. This suggests that perhaps the genome repeats of sauropsids were very different compared to mammals, birds and lizards. 
The genes of the [major histocompatibility complex] major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known to play roles in disease resistance, [mate choice] mate choice , and kin recognition in various vertebrate species. Among known vertebrate genomes, MHCs are considered one of the most polymorphic. In the tuatara, 56 MHC genes have been identified; some of which are similar to MHCs of amphibians and mammals. Most MHCs that were annotated in the tuatara genome are highly conserved, however there is large genomic rearrangement observed in distant [lepidosaur] lepidosaur lineages. 
Many of the elements that have been analyzed are present in all [amniotes] amniotes , most are mammalian interspersed repeats or MIR, specifically the diversity of MIR subfamilies is the highest that has been studied so far in an amniote. 16 families of [SINEs] SINEs that were recently active have also been identified. 
The tuatara has 24 unique families of [DNA transposons] DNA transposons , and at least 30 subfamilies were recently active. This diversity is greater than what has been found in other amniotes and in addition, thousands of identical copies of these transposons have been analyzed, suggesting to researchers that there is recent activity. 
The genome is the second largest known to reptiles. Only the [Greek tortoise] Greek tortoise genome is larger. Around 7,500 [LTRs] LTRs have been identified, including 450 [endogenous retroviruses] endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Studies in other [Sauropsida] Sauropsida have recognized a similar number but nevertheless, in the genome of the tuatara it has been found a very old clade of retrovirus known as [Spumavirus] Spumavirus . 
More than 8,000 [non-coding RNA] non-coding RNA -related elements have been identified in the tuatara genome, of which the vast majority, about 6,900, are derived from recently active [transposable elements] transposable elements . The rest are related to ribosomal, [spliceosomal] spliceosomal and [signal recognition particle RNA] signal recognition particle RNA . 
The [mitochondrial genome] mitochondrial genome of the genus Sphenodon Sphenodon is approximately 18,000 bp in size and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 [ribosomal RNA] ribosomal RNA and 22 [transfer RNA] transfer RNA genes. 
[DNA methylation] DNA methylation is a very common modification in animals and the distribution of [CpG sites] CpG sites within genomes affects this methylation. Specifically, 81% of these CpG sites have been found to be methylated in the tuatara genome. Recent publications propose that this high level of methylation may be due to the amount of repeating elements that exist in the genome of this animal. This pattern is closer to what occurs in organisms such as zebrafish, about 78%, while in humans it is only 70%. 
== Conservation ==
Tuatara are absolutely protected under New Zealand's [Wildlife Act 1953] Wildlife Act 1953 . The species is also listed under Appendix I of the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning commercial international trade in wild sourced specimens is prohibited and all other international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permit system. 
=== Distribution and threats ===
Tuatara were once widespread on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where [subfossil] subfossil remains have been found in sand dunes, caves, and Māori [middens] middens . Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32 offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, kiore kiore (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, tuatara were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the distinct tuatara populations had become extinct in the past century. 
The recent discovery of a tuatara hatchling on the mainland indicates that attempts to re-establish a breeding population on the New Zealand mainland have had some success. The total population of tuatara is estimated to be between 60,000 and 100,000. 
Tuatara have temperature-dependent sex determination meaning that the temperature of the egg determines the sex of the animal. For tuatara, lower egg incubation temperatures lead to females while higher temperatures lead to males. Since global temperatures are increasing, climate change may be skewing the male to female ratio of tuatara. Current solutions to this potential future threat are the selective removal of adults and the incubation of eggs. 
=== Eradication of rats ===
Tuatara were removed from [Stanley] Stanley , [Red Mercury] Red Mercury and [Cuvier Islands] Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and maintained in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, [Little Barrier Island] Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into in situ [in situ] in situ captivity, where females produced 42 eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there. 
In the [Hen and Chicken Islands] Hen and Chicken Islands , Polynesian rats were eradicated on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles have once again been seen on the latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara have been seen there as of 2001. In the [Alderman Islands] Alderman Islands , Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this. Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of [D'Urville Island] D'Urville Island , to prepare for the release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001. 
Sphenodon punctatus guntheri Sphenodon punctatus guntheri is present naturally on one small island with a population of approximately 400. In 1995, 50 juvenile and 18 adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in [Cook Strait] Cook Strait , and their establishment monitored. Two years later, more than half of the animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34 juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults were similarly transferred to [Matiu/Somes Island] Matiu/Somes Island , a more publicly accessible location in Wellington Harbour. The captive juveniles were from induced layings from wild females. 
In late October 2007, 50 tuatara collected as eggs from North Brother Island and hatched at [Victoria University] Victoria University were being released onto [Long Island] Long Island in the outer [Marlborough Sounds] Marlborough Sounds . The animals had been cared for at Wellington Zoo for the previous five years and had been kept in secret in a specially built enclosure at the zoo, off display. 
There is another out of country population of Brothers Island tuatara that was given to the [San Diego Zoological Society] San Diego Zoological Society and is housed off-display at the [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo facility in Balboa. No successful reproductive efforts have been reported yet.
S. punctatus punctatus S. punctatus punctatus naturally occurs on 29 islands, and its population is estimated to be over 60,000 individuals. In 1996, 32 adult northern tuatara were moved from [Moutoki Island] Moutoki Island to [Moutohora] Moutohora . The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara. In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to [Tiritiri Matangi Island] Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the [Mercury group] Mercury group . They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island. 
A mainland release of S.p. punctatus S.p. punctatus occurred in 2005 in the heavily fenced and monitored [Karori Sanctuary] Karori Sanctuary . The second mainland release took place in October 2007, when a further 130 were transferred from [Stephens Island] Stephens Island to the Karori Sanctuary. In early 2009, the first recorded wild-born offspring were observed. 
=== Captive breeding ===
The first successful breeding of tuatara in captivity is believed to have achieved by Sir [Algernon Thomas] Algernon Thomas at either his University offices or residence in Symonds Street in the late 1880s or his new home, Trewithiel, in Mount Eden in the early 1890s. 
Several tuatara breeding programmes are active in New Zealand. [Southland Museum and Art Gallery] Southland Museum and Art Gallery in [Invercargill] Invercargill was the first institution to have a tuatara breeding programme; starting in 1986 they bred S. punctatus S. punctatus and have focused on S. guntheri S. guntheri more recently. 
[Hamilton Zoo] Hamilton Zoo , [Auckland Zoo] Auckland Zoo and [Wellington Zoo] Wellington Zoo also breed tuatara for release into the wild. At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was discovered that tuatara have [temperature-dependent sex determination] temperature-dependent sex determination .
The [Victoria University of Wellington] Victoria University of Wellington maintains a research programme into the captive breeding of tuatara, and the [Pūkaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre] Pūkaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre keeps a pair and a juvenile. 
The WildNZ Trust has a tuatara breeding enclosure at [Ruawai] Ruawai . One notable captive breeding success story took place in January 2009, when all 11 eggs belonging to 110 year-old tuatara Henry and 80 year-old tuatara Mildred hatched. This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed. 
In January 2016, [Chester Zoo] Chester Zoo , England, announced that they succeeded in breeding the tuatara in captivity for the first time outside its homeland. 
== Cultural significance ==
Tuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends, and are held as ariki ariki (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of [Whiro] Whiro , the [god] god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. Tuatara also indicate tapu tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana mana , meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a taonga [taonga] taonga (special treasure) along with being viewed as the [kaitiaki] kaitiaki (guardian) of knowledge. 
The tuatara was featured on one side of the [New Zealand five-cent coin] New Zealand five-cent coin , which was phased out in October 2006. Tuatara Tuatara was also the name of the Journal of the Biological Society of Victoria University College and subsequently [Victoria University of Wellington] Victoria University of Wellington , published from 1947 until 1993. It has now been digitised by the [New Zealand Electronic Text Centre] New Zealand Electronic Text Centre , also at Victoria.

Olm,Olm,"The olm olm ( .mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%} .mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%} German: German:  [ɔlm] [[ɔlm]] [ɔlm]  [] ) or proteus proteus ( Proteus anguinus Proteus anguinus Proteus anguinus ) is an aquatic [salamander] salamander which is the only [species] species in the genus Proteus Proteus Proteus of the family [Proteidae] Proteidae and the only [exclusively cave-dwelling] exclusively cave-dwelling  [chordate] chordate species found in Europe; the family's other extant genus is Necturus [Necturus] Necturus . In contrast to most [amphibians] amphibians , it is entirely [aquatic] aquatic , eating, sleeping, and breeding underwater. Living in caves found in the [Dinaric Alps] Dinaric Alps , it is [endemic] endemic to the waters that flow underground through the extensive limestone bedrock of the [karst] karst of [Central] Central and [Southeastern Europe] Southeastern Europe in the basin of the [Soča] Soča River ( [Italian] Italian : Isonzo Isonzo ) near [Trieste] Trieste , [Italy] Italy , southern [Slovenia] Slovenia , southwestern [Croatia] Croatia , and [Bosnia and Herzegovina] Bosnia and Herzegovina .  [Introduced] Introduced populations are found near [Vicenza] Vicenza , Italy, and [Kranj] Kranj , [Slovenia] Slovenia . It was first mentioned in 1689 by the local [naturalist] naturalist  [Valvasor] Valvasor in his Glory of the Duchy of Carniola [Glory of the Duchy of Carniola] Glory of the Duchy of Carniola , who reported that, after heavy rains, the olms were washed up from the underground waters and were believed by local people to be a cave [dragon] dragon 's offspring.
This [cave salamander] cave salamander is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete darkness in its underground habitat. The olm's [eyes] eyes are [undeveloped] undeveloped , leaving it blind, while its other [senses] senses , particularly those of [smell] smell and [hearing] hearing , are acutely developed. Most populations also lack any [pigmentation] pigmentation in their [skin] skin . The olm has three toes on its forelimbs, but only two toes on its hind feet. It exhibits [neoteny] neoteny , retaining [larval] larval characteristics like external [gills] gills into adulthood, like some American amphibians, the [axolotl] axolotl and the mudpuppies ( Necturus Necturus ).
== Etymology ==
The word olm olm is a [German] German  [loanword] loanword that was incorporated into English in the late 19th century. The origin of the German Olm Olm Olm or Grottenolm Grottenolm Grottenolm 'cave olm', is unclear. It may be a variant of the word Molch Molch Molch 'salamander'. 
=== Common names ===
It is also called the ""human fish"" by locals because of its fleshy skin color (translated literally from [Slovene] Slovene : človeška ribica človeška ribica , [Macedonian] Macedonian : човечка рипка човечка рипка , [Croatian] Croatian : čovječja ribica čovječja ribica , [Bosnian] Bosnian : čovječija ribica čovječija ribica , [Serbian] Serbian : човечја рибица човечја рибица ), as well as ""cave salamander"" or ""white salamander"". In Slovenia, it is called močeril močeril (from * močerъ močerъ 'earthworm, damp creepy-crawly'; moča moča 'dampness'). 
== Description ==
=== External appearance ===
The olm's body is [snakelike] snakelike , 20–30 cm (8–12 in) long, with some specimens reaching up to 40 centimetres (16 in), which makes them some of the largest cave-dwelling animals in the world. The average length is between 23 and 25 cm. Females grow larger than males, but otherwise the primary external difference between the sexes is in the [cloaca] cloaca region (shape and size) when breeding. The trunk is cylindrical, uniformly thick, and segmented with regularly spaced furrows at the [myomere] myomere borders. The [tail] tail is relatively short, laterally flattened, and surrounded by a thin fin. The limbs are small and thin, with a reduced number of digits compared to other amphibians: the front legs have three digits instead of the normal four, and the rear have two digits instead of five. Its body is covered by a thin layer of skin, which contains very little of the [pigment] pigment  [riboflavin] riboflavin , making it yellowish-white or pink in color. 
The white skin color of the olm retains the ability to produce [melanin] melanin , and will gradually turn dark when exposed to light; in some cases the [larvae] larvae are also colored. One population, the [black olm] black olm , is always pigmented and dark brownish to blackish when adult. The olm's pear-shaped head ends with a short, dorsoventrally flattened snout. The mouth opening is small, with tiny [teeth] teeth forming a [sieve] sieve to keep larger particles inside the mouth. The nostrils are so small as to be imperceptible, but are placed somewhat [laterally] laterally near the end of the snout. The regressed [eyes] eyes are covered by a layer of skin. The olm breathes with external [gills] gills that form two branched tufts at the back of the head. They are red in color because the oxygen-rich [blood] blood shows through the non-pigmented skin. The olm also has rudimentary [lungs] lungs , but their role in respiration is only accessory, except during [hypoxic] hypoxic conditions. 
=== Sensory organs ===
Cave-dwelling animals have been prompted, among other adaptations, to develop and improve non-visual sensory systems in order to orient in and adapt to permanently dark habitats. The olm's sensory system is also adapted to life in the subterranean aquatic environment. Unable to use vision for orientation, the olm compensates with other senses, which are better developed than in amphibians living on the surface. It retains larval proportions, like a long, slender body and a large, flattened head, and is thus able to carry a larger number of [sensory receptors] sensory receptors . 
Although blind, the olm swims away from light. The eyes are regressed, but retain sensitivity. They lie deep below the [dermis of the skin] dermis of the skin and are rarely visible except in some younger adults. Larvae have normal eyes, but development soon stops and they start regressing, finally atrophying after four months of development. The [pineal body] pineal body also has photoreceptive cells which, though regressed, retain visual pigment like the photoreceptive cells of the regressed eye. The pineal gland in Proteus Proteus probably possesses some control over the physiological processes.  [Behavioral] Behavioral experiments revealed that the skin itself is also sensitive to light. Photosensitivity of the integument is due to the pigment [melanopsin] melanopsin inside specialized cells called [melanophores] melanophores . Preliminary immunocytochemical analyses support the existence of photosensitive pigment also in the animal's integument. 
The olm is capable of sensing very low concentrations of organic compounds in the water. They are better at sensing both the quantity and quality of prey by smell than related amphibians. The nasal [epithelium] epithelium , located on the inner surface of the nasal cavity and in the [Jacobson's organ] Jacobson's organ , is thicker than in other amphibians. The [taste buds] taste buds are in the [mucous] mucous epithelium of the mouth, most of them on the upper side of the [tongue] tongue and on the entrance to the gill cavities. Those in the oral cavity are used for tasting food, where those near the gills probably sense chemicals in the surrounding water. 
The sensory [epithelia] epithelia of the [inner ear] inner ear are very specifically differentiated, enabling the olm to receive [sound] sound waves in the water, as well as [vibrations] vibrations from the ground. The complex functional-morphological orientation of the sensory cells enables the animal to register the sound sources. As this animal stays [neotenic] neotenic throughout its long life span, it is only occasionally exposed to normal adult hearing in air, which is probably also possible for Proteus Proteus as in most salamanders. Hence, it would be of adaptive value in caves, with no vision available, to profit from underwater hearing by recognizing particular sounds and eventual localization of prey or other sound sources, i.e. acoustical orientation in general.
Behavioural (ethological) tests have shown that its sensitivity for detecting underwater sound waves reaches into the area of frequencies of sound waves between 10 and more than 12,000 Hz, while the greatest sensitivity is reached between  1,500 and 2,000 Hz.The ethological experiments indicate that the best hearing sensitivity of Proteus Proteus is between 10 Hz and up to 12,000 Hz. The [lateral line] lateral line supplements inner ear sensitivity by registering low-frequency nearby water displacements. 
A new type of [electroreception] electroreception sensory organ has been analyzed on the head of Proteus Proteus , utilizing light and [electron microscopy] electron microscopy . These new organs have been described as [ampullary organs] ampullary organs . 
Like some other lower [vertebrates] vertebrates , the olm has the ability to register weak [electric fields] electric fields . Some behavioral experiments suggest that the olm may be able to use Earth's [magnetic field] magnetic field to orient itself. In 2002, Proteus Proteus  anguinus anguinus was found to align itself with natural and artificially modified magnetic fields. 
== Ecology and life history ==
The olm lives in well-oxygenated underground waters with a typical, very stable temperature of 8–11 °C (46–52 °F), infrequently as warm as 14 °C (57 °F). There have also been observations in northeastern Italy where they swim to the surface in springs outside the caves, even in daylight, where they occasionally feed on earthworms. The black olm may occur in surface waters that are somewhat warmer. 
The olm swims by eel-like twisting of its body, assisted only slightly by its poorly developed legs. It is a [predatory] predatory animal, feeding on small [crustaceans] crustaceans (for example, Troglocaris [Troglocaris] Troglocaris shrimp, Niphargus [Niphargus] Niphargus , Asellus [Asellus] Asellus , and Synurella Synurella amphipods, and Oniscus asellus [Oniscus asellus] Oniscus asellus ), [snails] snails (for example, Belgrandiella [Belgrandiella] Belgrandiella ), and occasionally [insects] insects and insect larvae (for example, [Trichoptera] Trichoptera , [Ephemeroptera] Ephemeroptera , [Plecoptera] Plecoptera , and [Diptera] Diptera ). It does not chew its food, instead swallowing it whole. The olm is resistant to long-term starvation, an adaptation to its underground habitat. It can consume large amounts of food at once, and store nutrients as large deposits of [lipids] lipids and [glycogen] glycogen in the [liver] liver . When food is scarce, it reduces its activity and [metabolic rate] metabolic rate , and can also reabsorb its own tissues in severe cases. Controlled experiments have shown that an olm can survive up to 10 years without food. 
Olms are [gregarious] gregarious , and usually aggregate either under stones or in fissures. Sexually active males are an exception, establishing and defending territories where they attract females. The scarcity of food makes fighting energetically costly, so encounters between males usually only involve [display] display . This is a behavioral adaptation to life underground. 
=== Breeding and longevity ===
Reproduction has only been observed in captivity so far. Sexually mature males have swollen cloacas, brighter skin color, two lines at the side of the tail, and slightly curled fins. No such changes have been observed in the females. The male can start courtship even without the presence of a female. He chases other males away from the chosen area, and may then secrete a female-attracting [pheromone] pheromone . When the female approaches, he starts to circle around her and fan her with his tail. Then he starts to touch the female's body with his snout, and the female touches his cloaca with her snout. At that point, he starts to move forward with a twitching motion, and the female follows. He then deposits the [spermatophore] spermatophore , and the animals keep moving forward until the female hits it with her cloaca, after which she stops and stands still. The spermatophore sticks to her and the [sperm] sperm cells swim inside her cloaca, where they attempt to fertilize her eggs. The courtship ritual can be repeated several times over a couple of hours. 
The female lays up to 70 eggs, each about 12 millimetres (0.5 in) in diameter, and places them between rocks, where they remain under her protection. The average is 35 eggs and the adult female typically breeds every 12.5 years. The tadpoles are 2 centimetres (0.8 in) long when they hatch and live on [yolk] yolk stored in the cells of the digestive tract for a month. 
At a temperature of 10 °C (50 °F), the olm's [embryonic] embryonic development (time in the eggs before hatching) is 140 days, but it is somewhat slower in colder water and faster in warmer, being as little as 86 days at 15 °C (59 °F). After hatching, it takes another 14 years to reach sexual maturity if living in water that is 10 °C (50 °F). The larvae gain adult appearance after nearly four months, with the duration of development strongly correlating with water temperature. Unconfirmed historical observations of [viviparity] viviparity exist, but it has been shown that the females possess a [gland] gland that produces the egg casing, similar to those of [fish] fish and egg-laying amphibians.  [Paul Kammerer] Paul Kammerer reported that female olm gave birth to live young in water at or below 13 °C (55 °F) and laid eggs at higher, but rigorous observations have not confirmed that. The olm appears to be exclusively [oviparous] oviparous . 
Development of the olm and other [troglobite] troglobite amphibians is characterized by [heterochrony] heterochrony – the animal does not undergo [metamorphosis] metamorphosis and instead retains larval features. The form of heterochrony in the olm is [neoteny] neoteny – delayed [somatic] somatic maturity with precocious reproductive maturity, i.e. reproductive maturity is reached while retaining the larval external [morphology] morphology . In other amphibians, the metamorphosis is regulated by the [hormone] hormone  [thyroxine] thyroxine , secreted by the [thyroid] thyroid gland. The thyroid is normally developed and functioning in the olm, so the lack of metamorphosis is due to the unresponsiveness of key [tissues] tissues to thyroxine. 
Longevity is estimated at up to 58 years. A study published in Biology Letters [Biology Letters] Biology Letters estimated that they have a maximum lifespan of over 100 years and that the lifespan of an average adult is around 68.5 years. When compared to the longevity and body mass of other amphibians, olms are [outliers] outliers , living longer than would be predicted from their size. 
== Taxonomic history ==
Olms from different cave systems differ substantially in body measurements, color, and some microscopic characteristics. Earlier researchers used these differences to support the division into five species, while modern herpetologists understand that external morphology is not reliable for amphibian systematics and can be extremely variable, depending on nourishment, illness, and other factors; even varying among individuals in a single [population] population . Proteus anguinus Proteus anguinus is now considered a single species. The length of the head is the most obvious difference between the various populations – individuals from Stična, Slovenia, have shorter heads on average than those from [Tržič] Tržič , Slovenia, and the [Istrian] Istrian peninsula, for example. 
=== Black olm ===
The black olm black olm ( Proteus anguinus parkelj Proteus anguinus parkelj Proteus anguinus parkelj  Sket & Arntzen, 1994 Sket & Arntzen, 1994 ) is the only recognized [subspecies] subspecies of the olm other than the [nominate subspecies] nominate subspecies . It is [endemic] endemic to the underground waters near [Črnomelj] Črnomelj , Slovenia, an area smaller than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi). It was first found in 1986 by members of the [Slovenian Karst Research Institute] Slovenian Karst Research Institute , who were exploring the water from [Dobličica karst spring] Dobličica karst spring in the [White Carniola] White Carniola region. 
It has several features separating it from the [nominotypical subspecies] nominotypical subspecies ( Proteus a. anguinus Proteus a. anguinus ): 
=== Proteus bavaricus ===
A potential species, Proteus bavaricus Proteus bavaricus , is speculated to be closely related to P. anguinus P. anguinus .  [The species was described] The species was described from a single bone by George Brunner, and the [holotype] holotype is housed in his private collection. It was found in [Bavaria] Bavaria 's [Devil's Cave] Devil's Cave , in the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene layer. In his 1998 book, J. Alan Hollman described the species as a ""problematic"" taxon, saying that Brunner's drawing of the bone does not adequately show the differences between P. bavaricus P. bavaricus and P. anguinus P. anguinus . 
== Research history ==
The first written mention of the olm is in [Johann Weikhard von Valvasor] Johann Weikhard von Valvasor 's The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola [The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola] The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola (1689) as a baby [dragon] dragon . Heavy rains of Slovenia would wash the olms up from their subterranean habitat, giving rise to the folklore belief that great dragons lived beneath the Earth's crust, and the olms were the undeveloped offspring of these mythical beasts. In his book Valvasor compiled the local Slovenian folk stories and pieced together the rich mythology of the creature and documented observations of the olm as ""Barely a span long, akin to a lizard, in short, a worm and vermin of which there are many hereabouts"". 
The first researcher to retrieve a live olm was a physician and researcher from [Idrija] Idrija , [Giovanni Antonio Scopoli] Giovanni Antonio Scopoli , who sent dead specimens and drawings to colleagues and collectors. [Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti] Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti , though, was the first to briefly describe the olm in 1768 and give it the scientific name Proteus anguinus Proteus anguinus . It was not until the end of the century that [Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers] Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers from the [Naturhistorisches Museum] Naturhistorisches Museum of [Vienna] Vienna started to look into this animal's anatomy. The specimens were sent to him by [Sigmund Zois] Sigmund Zois . Schreibers presented his findings in 1801 to The [Royal Society] Royal Society in [London] London , and later also in [Paris] Paris . Soon, the olm started to gain wide recognition and attract significant attention, resulting in thousands of animals being sent to researchers and collectors worldwide. A Dr Edwards was quoted in a book of 1839 as believing that ""...the Proteus Anguinis is the first stage of an animal prevented from growing to perfection by inhabiting the subterraneous waters of Carniola."" 
In 1880 Marie von Chauvin began the first long-term study of olms in captivity. She learned that they detected prey's motion, panicked when a heavy object was dropped near their habitat, and developed color if exposed to weak light for a few hours a day, but could not cause them to change to a land-dwelling adult form, as she and others had done with [axolotl] axolotl . 
The basis of functional morphological investigations in Slovenia was set up by [Lilijana Istenič] Lilijana Istenič [ [de] de ] in the 1980s. More than twenty years later, the Research Group for functional morphological Studies of the Vertebrates in the Department of Biology (Biotechnical Faculty, [University of Ljubljana] University of Ljubljana ), is one of the leading groups studying the olm under the guidance of [Boris Bulog] Boris Bulog . There are also several cave laboratories in Europe in which olms have been introduced and are being studied. These are [Moulis, Ariège] Moulis, Ariège ( [France] France ), [Choranche  cave] Choranche  cave ( [France] France ), [Han-sur-Lesse] Han-sur-Lesse ( [Belgium] Belgium ), and [Aggtelek] Aggtelek ( [Hungary] Hungary ). They were also [introduced] introduced into the [Hermannshöhle] Hermannshöhle ( [Germany] Germany ) and [Oliero] Oliero ( [Italy] Italy ) caves, where they still live today. Additionally, there is evidence that a small number of olms were introduced to the United Kingdom in the 1940s, although it's highly likely that the animals perished shortly after being released. 
The olm was used by [Charles Darwin] Charles Darwin in his seminal work On the Origin of Species [On the Origin of Species] On the Origin of Species as an example for the reduction of structures through disuse: 
Far from feeling surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous...as is the case with blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of these dark abodes will have been exposed.
An olm (Proteus) genome project is currently underway by the [University of Ljubljana] University of Ljubljana and [BGI] BGI . With an estimated genome size roughly 15-times the size of human genome, this will likely be the largest [animal genome] animal genome sequenced so far. 
== Conservation ==
The olm is extremely vulnerable to changes in its environment, due to its adaptation to the specific conditions in caves. Water resources in the karst are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution. The contamination of the karst underground waters is due to the large number of waste disposal sites leached by rainwater, as well as to the accidental overflow of various liquids. The reflection of such pollution in the karst underground waters depends on the type and quantity of pollutants, and on the rock structure through which the waters penetrate. Self-purification processes in the underground waters are not completely understood, but they are quite different from those in surface waters. 
Among the most serious chemical [pollutants] pollutants are chlorinated hydrocarbon [pesticides] pesticides , [fertilizers] fertilizers , [polychlorinated biphenyls] polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are or were used in a variety of industrial processes and in the manufacture of many kinds of materials; and metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. All of these substances persist in the environment, being slowly, if at all, degraded by natural processes. In addition, all are toxic to life if they accumulate in any appreciable quantity. The olm is nevertheless noted for its capability of surviving higher concentrations of accumulated PCBs than related aquatic organisms. 
The olm was included in annexes II and IV of the 1992 EU [Habitats Directive] Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The list of species in annex II, combined with the habitats listed in annex I, is used by individual countries to designate [protected areas] protected areas known as 'Special Areas of Conservation'. These areas, combined with others created by the older [Birds Directive] Birds Directive were to form the [Natura 2000] Natura 2000 network. Annex IV additionally lists ""animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection"", although this has little legal ramifications. Areas inhabited by the olm were eventually included in the Slovenian, Italian and Croatian parts of the Natura 2000 network. 
The olm was first protected in Slovenia in 1922 along with all cave fauna, but the protection was not effective and a substantial black market came into existence. In 1982 it was placed on a list of rare and endangered species. This list also had the effect of prohibiting trade of the species. After joining the [European Union] European Union in 2004, Slovenia had to establish mechanisms for protection of the species included in the EU Habitats Directive. The olm is included in a [Slovenian Red list] Slovenian Red list Slovenian Red list of endangered species, thus its capturing or killing is allowed only under specific circumstances determined by the local authorities (e.g. scientific study). 
In Croatia, the olm is protected by the legislation designed to protect amphibians – collecting is possible only for research purposes by permission of the National Administration for Nature and Environment Protection. As of 2020 the Croatian population has been assessed as ' [critically endangered] critically endangered ' in Croatia. As of 1999, the environmental laws in [Bosnia and Herzegovina] Bosnia and Herzegovina and [Montenegro] Montenegro had not yet been clarified for this species.
In the 1980s the [IUCN] IUCN claimed that some illegal collection of this species for the pet trade took place, but that the extent of this was unknown: this text has been copied into subsequent assessments, but by now the anecdotic claims are not considered to be indicative of a major threat. Since the 1980s until the most recent assessment in 2022 the organisation has rated the conservation status for the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List as ' [vulnerable] vulnerable ', this because of its natural distribution being fragmented over a number of cave systems as opposed to being continuous, and what they consider a decline in extent and quality of its habitat, which they assume means that the population has been decreasing for the last 40 years. 
[Zagreb Zoo] Zagreb Zoo in Croatia houses the olm. Historically, olms were kept in several zoos in Germany, as well as in Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom. At present they can only be experienced at Zagreb Zoo, [Hermannshöhle] Hermannshöhle Hermannshöhle in Germany and [Vivarium Proteus] Vivarium Proteus (Proteus Vivarium) within Postojnska jama Postojnska jama (Postojna Cave) in Slovenia. There are also captive breeding programs in places like France. 
== Cultural significance ==
The olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage. The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery. [Postojna Cave] Postojna Cave is one of the birthplaces of [biospeleology] biospeleology due to the olm and other rare cave inhabitants, such as the [blind cave beetle] blind cave beetle . The image of the olm contributes significantly to the fame of Postojna Cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of [ecotourism] ecotourism in [Postojna] Postojna and other parts of Slovenian karst. Tours of Postojna Cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station – the Proteus [vivarium] vivarium , showing different aspects of the cave environment. 
The olm was also depicted on one of the [Slovenian tolar] Slovenian tolar coins. It was also the namesake of Proteus Proteus , the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.

The spectacled bear spectacled bear ( Tremarctos ornatus Tremarctos ornatus Tremarctos ornatus ), also known as the South American bear South American bear , Andean bear Andean bear , Andean short-faced bear Andean short-faced bear or mountain bear mountain bear and locally as jukumari jukumari ( [Aymara] Aymara and [Quechua] Quechua ), ukumari ukumari ( [Quechua] Quechua ) or ukuku ukuku , is a species of [bear] bear native to the [Andes] Andes Mountains in northern and western [South America] South America . It is the only living species of bear native to South America, and the last remaining [short-faced bear] short-faced bear (subfamily [Tremarctinae] Tremarctinae ). Its closest relatives are the extinct Tremarctos floridanus [Tremarctos floridanus] Tremarctos floridanus , and the giant short-faced bears ( Arctodus [Arctodus] Arctodus and Arctotherium [Arctotherium] Arctotherium ), which became extinct at the end of the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago. Unlike other omnivorous bears, the diet of the spectacled bear is mostly herbivorous. The species is classified as [Vulnerable] Vulnerable by the [IUCN] IUCN because of habitat loss.
== Description ==
The spectacled bear is the only bear native to [South America] South America and is the largest land carnivore in that part of the world, although as little as 5% of its diet is composed of meat. Among South America's extant, native land animals, only the [Baird's tapir] Baird's tapir , [South American tapir] South American tapir and [mountain tapir] mountain tapir are heavier than the bear. 
The spectacled bear is a mid-sized species of bear. Overall, its fur is blackish in colour, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. The species typically has distinctive beige or ginger-coloured markings across its face and upper chest, though not all spectacled bears have ""spectacle"" markings. The pattern and extent of pale markings are slightly different on each individual bear, and bears can be readily distinguished by this. Males are a third larger than females in dimensions and sometimes twice their weight. Males can weigh from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb), and females can weigh from 35 to 82 kg (77 to 181 lb). Head-and-body length can range from 120 to 200 cm (47 to 78.5 in), though mature males do not measure less than 150 cm (59 in). On average males weigh about 115 kg (254 lb) and females average about 65 kg (143 lb), thus it rivals the polar bear for the most sexually dimorphic modern bear. A male in captivity that was considered obese weighed 222.5 kg (491 lb). The tail is a mere 7 cm (2.8 in) in length, and the shoulder height is from 60 to 90 cm (23.5 to 35.5 in). Compared to other living bears, this species has a more rounded face with a relatively short and broad snout. In some extinct species of the Tremarctinae subfamily, this facial structure has been thought to be an adaptation to a largely carnivorous diet, despite the modern spectacled bears' herbivorous dietary preferences. 
The spectacled bear's sense of smell is extremely sensitive. They can perceive from the ground when a tree is loaded with ripe fruit. On the other hand, their hearing is moderate and their vision is short. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Despite some rare spilling-over into eastern [Panama] Panama , spectacled bears are mostly restricted to certain areas of northern and western South America. They can range in western [Venezuela] Venezuela ,  [Colombia] Colombia , [Ecuador] Ecuador , [Peru] Peru , western [Bolivia] Bolivia , and northwestern [Argentina] Argentina . Its elongated geographical distribution is only 200 to 650 km (120 to 400 mi) wide but with a length of more than 4,600 km (2,900 mi). 
The species is found almost entirely in the [Andes Mountains] Andes Mountains . Before spectacled bear populations became fragmented during the last 500 years, the species had a reputation for being adaptable, as it is found in a wide variety of habitats and altitudes throughout its range, including [cloud forests] cloud forests , [high-altitude grasslands] high-altitude grasslands , [dry forests] dry forests and [scrub deserts] scrub deserts . A single spectacled bear population on the border of [Peru] Peru and [Ecuador] Ecuador inhabited as great a range of habitat types as the world's [brown bears] brown bears ( Ursus arctos Ursus arctos ) now occupy. The best habitats for spectacled bears are humid to very humid montane forests. These cloud forests typically occupy a 500 to 1,000 m (1,600 to 3,300 ft) elevational band between 1,000 and 2,700 m (3,300 and 8,900 ft) depending on latitude. Generally, the wetter these forests are the more food species there are that can support bears. Occasionally, they may reach altitudes as low as 250 m (820 ft), but are not typically found below 1,900 m (6,200 ft) in the [foothills] foothills . They can even range up to the [mountain snow line] mountain snow line at over 5,000 m (16,000 ft) in elevation. Therefore, it is well known that bears use all these types of habitats in regional movements; however, the seasonal patterns of these movements are still unknown. 
Nowadays, the distribution area of the Tremarctos ornatus Tremarctos ornatus is influenced by the human presence, mainly due to habitat destruction and degradation, hunting and fragmentation of populations. This fragmentation is mainly found in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Argentina. It represents several problems to this population because, first, their persistence is compromised if they are small, isolated populations, even without facing habitat lost or hunting. Second, the transformation of the landscape represents loss of availability of the type of habitats spectacled bears need. Third, fragmentation exposes bears to hunting and killing due to its accessibility. 
== Naming and etymology ==
Tremarctos ornatus Tremarctos ornatus is commonly referred to in English as the ""spectacled bear"", a reference to the light colouring on its chest, neck and face, which may resemble [spectacles] spectacles in some individuals, or the ""Andean bear"" for its distribution along the Andes. The root trem trem - comes from a Greek word meaning ""hole""; arctos arctos is the Greek word for ""bear"". Tremarctos Tremarctos is a reference to an unusual hole on the animal's [humerus] humerus . Ornatus Ornatus Ornatus , Latin for ""decorated"", is a reference to the markings that give the bear its common English name. 
== Phylogeny ==
A 2007 investigation into the mitochondrial DNA of bear species indicates that the subfamily Tremarctinae, which includes the extant spectacled bear, diverged from the Ursinae subfamily approximately 5.7 million years ago. Tremarctinae includes the extinct American giant short-faced and Florida short-faced bears.
== Behaviour and diet ==
Spectacled bears are one of four extant bear species that are habitually [arboreal] arboreal , alongside the [American black bear] American black bear ( Ursus americanus Ursus americanus ) and [Asian black bear] Asian black bear ( U. thibetanus U. thibetanus ), and the [sun bear] sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus Helarctos malayanus ). In Andean cloud forests, spectacled bears may be active both during the day and night, but 
specimens in the Peruvian desert are reported to bed down under vegetative cover during the day. Their continued survival alongside humans has depended mostly on their ability to climb even the tallest trees of the [Andes] Andes . They usually retreat from the presence of humans, often by climbing trees. Once up a tree, they may often build a platform, perhaps to aid in concealment, as well as to rest and store food on. Although spectacled bears are solitary and tend to isolate themselves from one another to avoid competition, they are not territorial. They have even been recorded to feed in small groups at abundant food sources. Males are reported to have an average home range of 23 km (8.9 sq mi) during the wet season and 27 km (10 sq mi) during the dry season. Females are reported to have an average home range of 10 km (3.9 sq mi) in the [wet season] wet season and 7 km (2.7 sq mi) in the [dry season] dry season . 
When encountered by humans or other spectacled bears, they will react in a docile but cautious manner, unless the intruder is seen as a threat or a mother's cubs are endangered. Like other bears, mothers are protective of their young and have attacked poachers. There is only a single reported human death due to a spectacled bear, which occurred while it was being hunted and was already shot. The only predators of cubs include [cougars] cougars ( Puma concolor Puma concolor ) and possibly male spectacled bears. The bears ""appear to avoid"" [jaguars] jaguars , but the jaguar has considerably different habitat preferences, does not overlap with the spectacled bear in altitude on any specific mountain slope, and only overlaps slightly (900m) in altitude if the entire [Cordillera Oriental] Cordillera Oriental is considered based upon unpublished data. Generally, the only threat against adult bears is humans. The longest-lived captive bear, at the [National Zoo in Washington, DC] National Zoo in Washington, DC , in the US, attained a lifespan of 36 years and 8 months. Lifespan in the wild has not been studied, but bears are believed to commonly live to 20 years or more unless they run foul of humans. 
Spectacled bears are more herbivorous than most other bears; normally about 5 to 7% of their diets is meat. The most common foods for these bears include [cactus] cactus , [bromeliads] bromeliads (especially [Puyassp.] Puya Puya ssp. , Tillandsia [Tillandsia] Tillandsia ssp. and Guzmania [Guzmania] Guzmania ssp.) [palm nuts] palm nuts , [bamboo] bamboo hearts, [frailejon] frailejon ( Espeletia Espeletia spp.), [orchid] orchid bulbs, fallen [fruit] fruit on the forest floor, unopened [palm] palm leaves, and [moss] moss . They will also peel back tree bark to eat the nutritious second layer. Much of this vegetation is very tough to open or digest for most animals, and the bear is one of the few species in its range to exploit these food sources. The spectacled bear has the largest [zygomatic mandibular muscles] zygomatic mandibular muscles relative to its body size and the shortest muzzle of any living bear, slightly surpassing the relative size of the [giant panda] giant panda 's ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) morphology here. Not coincidentally, both species are known for extensively consuming tough, fibrous plants. Unlike the ursid bears whose fourth premolar has a more well-developed protoconid, an adaptation for shearing flesh, the fourth premolar of spectacled bears has blunt lophs with three pulp cavities instead of two, and can have three roots instead of the two that characterize ursid bears. The musculature and tooth characteristics are designed to support the stresses of grinding and crushing vegetation. Besides the giant panda, the spectacled bear is perhaps the most herbivorous living bear species. These bears also eat agricultural products, such as [sugarcane] sugarcane ( Saccharum Saccharum ssp.), [honey] honey (made by Apis Apis ssp.), and [maize] maize ( Zea mays Zea mays ), and have been known to travel above the [tree line] tree line for [berries] berries and more ground-based [bromeliads] bromeliads . When food is abundant, such as large corn fields, up to nine individual bears have fed close by each other in a single vicinity.
Animal prey is usually quite small, but these bears can prey on adult [deer] deer , [llama] llama ( Lama glama Lama glama ) and domestic [cattle] cattle ( Bos taurus Bos taurus ) and [horses] horses ( Equus caballus Equus caballus ). A spectacled bear was captured on a remote video-monitor predaceously attacking an adult [mountain tapir] mountain tapir perhaps nearly twice its own body mass, and adult horse and cattle killed by spectacled bears have been even heavier. Animal prey has included [rabbits] rabbits , [mice] mice , other [rodents] rodents , [birds] birds at the nest (especially ground-nesting birds like [tinamous] tinamous or [lapwings] lapwings ( Vanellus Vanellus ssp.), [arthropods] arthropods , and [carrion] carrion . They are occasionally accused of killing livestock, especially [cattle] cattle , and raiding corn fields. Allegedly, some bears become habituated to eating cattle, but the bears are actually more likely to eat cattle as carrion and some farmers may accidentally assume the spectacled bear killed them. Due to fear of loss of stock, bears may be killed on sight. 
== Reproduction ==
Most of the information available about the reproduction of this species has been through observation of captive animals. In captivity, mating is concentrated in between February and September, according to the latitude, and, in the wild, it has been seen how mating may occur at almost any time of the year, but activity normally peaks in April and June, at the beginning of the wet season and corresponding with the peak of fruit-ripening. The mating pair are together for one to two weeks, during which they will copulate multiple times for 12–45 minutes at a time. The courtship is based on games and non-aggressive fights while intercourse can be accompanied by loud sounds from both animals. 
In the wild, births usually occur in the dry season, between December and February but in captivity it occurs all year within the species' distribution. The gestation period is 5.5 to 8.5 months. From one to three cubs may be born, with four being rare and two being the average. The cubs are born with their eyes closed and weigh about 300 to 330 g (11 to 12 oz) each. Although this species does not give birth during the hibernation cycle as do northern bear species, births usually occur in a small den and the female waits until the cubs can see and walk before she leaves with them, this occurs in between three and four months after birth. 
Females grow more slowly than males. The size of the litter has been positively correlated with both the weight of the female and the abundance and variety of food sources, particularly the degree to which fruiting is temporally predictable. The cubs often stay with the female for one year before striking out on their own. This is related to the time mothers breastfeed (1 year), but keep providing maternal care for an additional year. Breeding maturity is estimated to be reached at between four and seven years of age for both sexes, based solely on captive bears. Females usually give birth for the first time when they are 5 years old and their fecundity is shorter than that of the males, who keep fertility almost all their lives. Something that is in favor of the subsistence of the bear population is their longevity, since they are able to raise at least two cubs to adulthood, contributing to population replacement. Wild bears can live for an average of 20 years. 
== Conservation ==
=== Threats ===
The Andean bear is threatened due to [poaching] poaching and habitat loss, attributable to agricultural expansion and [illegal mining] illegal mining . Poaching might have several reasons: [trophy hunting] trophy hunting , [pet trade] pet trade , religious or magical beliefs, [natural products] natural products trade and conflicts with humans. 
Trophy hunting of Andean bear was apparently popular during the 19th century in some rural areas of Latin-America. In the [costumbrist novel] costumbrist novel  María [María] María by Colombian writer [Jorge Isaacs] Jorge Isaacs , it was portrayed as an activity for privileged young men in Colombia. Tales regarding [pet] pet bears are also known from documents about the Ecuadorian [aristocracy] aristocracy of that time. These threats might have diminished in recent years, but there are still isolated reports of captive bears confiscated in rural areas, which usually are unable to adapt again to their natural habitat and must be kept in zoological facilities. 
Religious or magical beliefs might be motivations for killing Andean bears, especially in places where bears are related to myths of disappearing women or children, or where bear parts are related to traditional medicine or superstitions. In this context, the trade of bear parts might have commercial value. Their [gall bladders] gall bladders appear to be valued in [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine and can fetch a high price on the international market. Conflicts with humans, however, appear to be the most common cause of poaching in large portions of its distribution. Andean Bears are often suspected of attacking cattle and raiding crops, and are killed for retaliation or in order to avoid further damages. It has been argued that attacks to cattle attributed to Andean bear are partly due to other predators. Raiding of crops can be frequent in areas with diminishing natural resources and extensive crops in former bear habitat, or when problematic individuals get used to human environments.
The intensity of poaching can create ecological traps for Andean bears. That is, if bears are attracted to areas of high habitat quality that are also high in poaching risk. 
Perhaps the most epidemic problem for the species is extensive logging and farming, which has led to [habitat loss] habitat loss for the largely tree-dependent bears. Shortage of natural food sources might push bears to feed on crops or livestock, increasing the conflict that usually results in poaching of individuals. Impacts of climate changes on bear habitat and food sources are not fully understood, but might have potential negative impact in the near future.
As stated, one of the major limitations to the viability of bear populations is human-caused mortality, mainly poaching and habitat loss; but the other big limitation is population size. Therefore, the most effective actions for their viability will be to increase population size and decrease poaching. For these actions to be effective, it is needed to understand where they are carried out, identifying areas where habitat protection and landscape management are realistically capable of maintaining large bear populations. 
There are two views of the Andean Bears. One is ex-situ, people that live far from where the bears inhabit; for them, the spectacled bears are usually charismatic symbols of the wilderness, animals that are not aggressive and that are mainly vegetarians.  The other view is in-situ, people that live in areas where the bears inhabit; for them, bears are cattle predators, pests that should be killed as a preventative measure and where any cattle loss is immediately attributed to them, becoming persecuted and hunted. 
=== Conservation actions and plans ===
The [IUCN] IUCN has recommended the following courses for spectacled bear conservation: expansion and implementation of conservation land to prevent further development, greater species level research and monitoring of trends and threats, more concerted management of current conservation areas, stewardship programs for bears which engage local residents and the education of the public regarding spectacled bears, especially the benefits of conserving the species due to its effect on natural resources. 
National governments, NGOs and rural communities have made different commitments to conservation of this species along its distribution. Conservation actions in [Venezuela] Venezuela date back to the early 1990s, and have been based mostly on environmental education at several levels and the establishment of protected areas. The effort of several organisations has led to a widespread recognition of the Andean bear in Venezuelan society, raising it as an emblematic species of conservation efforts in the country, and to the establishment of a 10-year action plan. Evidence regarding the objective effectiveness of these programs (like reducing poaching risk, maintaining population viability, and reducing extinction risk) is subject to debate and needs to be further evaluated. 
Legislation against bear hunting exists, but is rarely enforced. This leads to persistence of the poaching problem, even inside protected areas. 
In 2006, the [Spectacled Bear Conservation Society] Spectacled Bear Conservation Society was established in Peru to study and protect the spectacled bear. 
To evaluate the protected status of the Andean bears researchers evaluated the percentage of their habitats included in national and protected areas in 1998.  This evaluation showed that only 18.5% of the bear range was located in 58 protected areas, highlighting that many of them were small, especially those in the northern Andes. The largest park had an area of 2,050 km (790 sq mi) while the median size of 43 parks from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador was 1,250 km (480 sq mi), which may result too small to maintain a sustainable bear population.  Therefore, these researchers stated the importance of the creation of habitat blocks outside protected areas since they might provide opportunities for the protection of these animals. 
Researchers suggest the following spectacled bear conservation strategies: 
=== Spectacled bear in Ecuador ===
Spectacled bears in Ecuador live in approximately 50,000 km (19,000 sq mi) of paramo and cloud forest habitats. About one-third of this area is part of the National System of Protected Areas and the remaining 67% is located on unprotected, undeveloped areas that have suffered a substantial reduction of approximately 40% from its original distribution. 
Due to this land-use conversion to agricultural uses, important amounts of the spectacled bear habitat have been lost. This has fragmented their territory and isolated populations to small areas that might result in extirpations in the long term. Therefore, the distribution of the species in the country is set in numerous habitat patches, from which many are small.

Secretary Bird,Secretarybird,"
The secretarybird secretarybird or secretary bird secretary bird ( Sagittarius serpentarius Sagittarius serpentarius Sagittarius serpentarius ) is a large [bird of prey] bird of prey that is [endemic] endemic to [Africa] Africa . It is mostly terrestrial, spending most of its time on the ground, and is usually found in the open grasslands and [savanna] savanna of the [sub-Saharan region] sub-Saharan region . [John Frederick Miller] John Frederick Miller described the species in 1779. A member of the order [Accipitriformes] Accipitriformes , which also includes many other [diurnal] diurnal birds of prey such as [eagles] eagles , [hawks] hawks , [kites] kites , [vultures] vultures , and [harriers] harriers , it is placed in its own family, [Sagittariidae] Sagittariidae .
The secretarybird is instantly recognizable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [crane-like] crane-like legs that give the bird a height of as much as 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in). The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [flight feathers] flight feathers and thighs.
Breeding can take place at any time of year but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three [eggs] eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Insects and small vertebrates make up its diet.
Although the secretarybird resides over a large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of [habitat destruction] habitat destruction . The species is therefore classed as [Endangered] Endangered by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature . The secretarybird appears on the [coats of arms] coats of arms of [Sudan] Sudan and [South Africa] South Africa .

The Dutch naturalist [Arnout Vosmaer] Arnout Vosmaer described the secretarybird in 1769 on the basis of a live specimen that had been sent to Holland from the [Cape of Good Hope] Cape of Good Hope two years earlier by an official of the [Dutch East India Company] Dutch East India Company . Vosmaer suggested that the species was called ""sagittarius"" by the Dutch settlers because its gait was thought to resemble an archer's. He also mentioned that it was known as the ""secretarius"" by farmers who had domesticated the bird to combat pests around their homesteads, and proposed that the word ""secretarius"" might be a corruption of ""sagittarius"". Ian Glenn of the [University of the Free State] University of the Free State suggests that Vosmaer's ""sagittarius"" is a misheard or mis-transcribed form of ""secretarius"", rather than the other way around. 
In 1779 the English illustrator [John Frederick Miller] John Frederick Miller included a coloured plate of the secretarybird in his Icones animalium et plantarum Icones animalium et plantarum and coined the [binomial name] binomial name  Falco serpentarius Falco serpentarius . As the oldest published specific name, serpentarius serpentarius has [priority] priority over later scientific names. The species was assigned to its own [genus] genus  Sagittarius Sagittarius in 1783 by the French naturalist [Johann Hermann] Johann Hermann in his Tabula affinitatum animalium Tabula affinitatum animalium . The generic name Sagittarius Sagittarius is [Latin] Latin for ""archer"", and the [specific epithet] specific epithet  serpentarius serpentarius is from Latin serpens serpens meaning ""serpent"" or ""snake"". A second edition of Miller's plates was published in 1796 as Cimelia physica Cimelia physica , with added text by English naturalist [George Shaw] George Shaw , who named it Vultur serpentarius Vultur serpentarius . The French naturalist [Georges Cuvier] Georges Cuvier erected the genus Serpentarius Serpentarius in 1798, and the German naturalist [Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger] Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger erected the (now [synonymous] synonymous ) genus Gypogeranus Gypogeranus from the Ancient Greek words gyps gyps ""vulture"" and geranos geranos ""crane"" in 1811. 
In 1835 the Irish naturalist [William Ogilby] William Ogilby spoke at a meeting of the [Zoological Society of London] Zoological Society of London and proposed three species of secretarybird, distinguishing those from [Senegambia] Senegambia as having broader crest feathers than those from South Africa, and reporting a distinct species from the Philippines based on the writings of [Pierre Sonnerat] Pierre Sonnerat in his Voyage à la Nouvelle-Guinée Voyage à la Nouvelle-Guinée . There is no other evidence this taxon existed. Despite its large range, the secretarybird is considered [monotypic] monotypic : no [subspecies] subspecies are recognised. 
The evolutionary relationship of the secretarybird to other raptors had long puzzled ornithologists. The species was usually placed in its own family [Sagittariidae] Sagittariidae within the order [Falconiformes] Falconiformes . A large [molecular phylogenetic] molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 concluded that the secretarybird was [sister] sister to a [clade] clade containing the ospreys in the family [Pandionidae] Pandionidae and the kites, hawks and eagles in the family [Accipitridae] Accipitridae . The same study found that the falcons in the order Falconiformes were only distantly related to the other diurnal birds of prey. The families [Cathartidae] Cathartidae , Sagittariidae, Pandionidae and Accipitridae were therefore moved from Falconiformes to the resurrected [Accipitriformes] Accipitriformes . A later molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 confirmed these relationships. 
The earliest [fossils] fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus [Pelargopappus] Pelargopappus . The two species, from the [Oligocene] Oligocene and [Miocene] Miocene respectively, were discovered in France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, the two species are not thought to be ancestral to the secretarybird. Though strongly convergent with the modern secretarybird, the extinct raptor Apatosagittarius [Apatosagittarius] Apatosagittarius is thought to be an accipitrid. 
The [International Ornithologists' Union] International Ornithologists' Union has designated ""secretarybird"" the official common name for the species. In 1780 the French polymath [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon suggested that the name secretary/secrétaire had been chosen because of the long quill-like feathers at the top of the bird's neck, reminiscent of a quill pen behind the ear of an ancient scribe. In 1977, C. Hilary Fry of [Aberdeen University] Aberdeen University suggested that ""secretary"" is from the French secrétaire secrétaire , a corruption of the Arabic صقر الطير صقر الطير صقر الطير  saqr et-tair saqr et-tair meaning either ""hawk of the semi-desert"" or ""hawk that flies"". Glenn has dismissed this etymology on the grounds that there is no evidence that the name came through French, instead supporting Buffon's etymology; namely, that the word comes from the Dutch secretaris secretaris ""secretary"", used by settlers in South Africa. 
== Description ==
The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large terrestrial bird with an [eagle-like] eagle-like head and body on [crane-like] crane-like legs. It stands about 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) tall. It has a length of between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in) and a wingspan of between 1.9 and 2.1 m (6 ft 3 in and 6 ft 11 in). The weight ranges from 3.74 to 4.27 kg (8.2 to 9.4 lb), with a mean of 4.05 kg (8.9 lb). The tarsus [tarsus] tarsus tarsus averages 31 cm (12 in) and the tail is 57–85 cm (22–33 in): both factor into making it both taller and longer than any other species of raptor. The neck is not especially long, and can only be lowered down to the [intertarsal joint] intertarsal joint , so birds must stoop to reach down to the ground. 
During flight, two elongated central feathers of the tail extend beyond the feet, and the neck stretches out like a [stork] stork . The plumage of the crown, upperparts, and lesser and median wing coverts is blue-grey, and the underparts and underwing coverts are lighter grey to grey-white. The crest is made up of long black feathers arising from the nape. The scapulars, primary and secondary [flight feathers] flight feathers , rump and thighs are black, while the uppertail coverts are white, though barred with black in some individuals. The tail is wedge-shaped with white tipping, marbled grey and black colouring at the base, and two broad black bands, one at the base and the other at the end. 
Sexes resemble one another, although the male tends to have longer tail feathers, more head plumes, a shorter head and more blue-grey plumage.  Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow [cere] cere . The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short—around 20% of the length of those of an eagle of the same size—and stout, so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet. The rear toe is small and the three forward facing toes are connected at the base by a small web. Immature birds have yellow rather than orange bare skin on their faces, more brownish plumage, shorter tail feathers and greyish rather than brown irises. 
Adults are normally silent but can utter a deep guttural croaking noise in nuptial displays or at nests. Secretarybirds make this sound when greeting their mates or in a threat display or fight against other birds, sometimes throwing their head backwards at the same time. When alarmed, the secretarybird may emit a high-pitched croak. Mated pairs at the nest make soft clucking or whistling calls. Chicks make a sharp sound heard as ""chee-uk-chee-uk-chee-uk"" for their first 30 days. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The secretarybird is endemic to [sub-Saharan Africa] sub-Saharan Africa and is generally [non-migratory] non-migratory , though it may be locally nomadic as it follows rainfall and the resulting abundance of prey. Its range extends from [Senegal] Senegal to [Somalia] Somalia and south to [Western Cape] Western Cape , [South Africa] South Africa . 
The species is also found at a variety of [elevations] elevations , from the [coastal plains] coastal plains to the highlands. The secretarybird prefers open [grasslands] grasslands , [savannas] savannas and [shrubland] shrubland ( [Karoo] Karoo ) rather than [forests] forests and dense [shrubbery] shrubbery that may impede its [cursorial] cursorial existence. More specifically, it prefers areas with grass under 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) high and avoids those with grass over 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high. It is rarer in grasslands in northern parts of its range that otherwise appear similar to areas in southern Africa where it is abundant, suggesting it may avoid hotter regions. It also avoids deserts. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Secretarybirds are not generally [gregarious] gregarious aside from pairs and their offspring. They usually [roost] roost in trees of the genus Acacia [Acacia] Acacia or Balanites [Balanites] Balanites , or even introduced pine trees in South Africa. They set off 1–2 hours after dawn, generally after spending some time [preening] preening . Mated pairs roost together but may forage separately, though often remaining in sight of one another. They pace around at a speed of 2.5–3 km/h (1.6–1.9 mph), taking 120 steps per minute on average. After spending much of the day on the ground, secretarybirds return at dusk, moving [downwind] downwind before flying in upwind. Birds encountered singly are often unattached males, their territories generally in less suitable areas. Conversely, larger groups of up to 50 individuals may be present at an area with a localised resource such as a waterhole in a dry area or an irruption of rodents or locusts fleeing a fire. 
Secretarybirds soar with their primary feathers splayed to manage turbulence. Their wings can flap, though in a slow laborious manner and requiring uplift to be sustained; otherwise they may become exhausted. In the heat of the day, they use [thermals] thermals to rise up to 3,800 m (12,500 ft) above the ground. 
The bird's average lifespan is thought to be 10 to 15 years in the wild and up to 19 years in captivity. The oldest confirmed secretarybird in the wild was a 5-year-old that was [banded] banded as a nestling on 23 July 2011 in [Bloemfontein] Bloemfontein and recovered 440 km (270 mi) away in [Mpumalanga] Mpumalanga on 7 June 2016. 
Secretarybirds, like all birds, have haematozoan blood parasites that include Leucocytozoon beaurepairei Leucocytozoon beaurepairei (Dias 1954 recorded from Mozambique). Wild birds from Tanzania have been found to have Hepatozoon ellisgreineri Hepatozoon ellisgreineri , a genus that is unique among avian haematozoa in maturing within [granulocytes] granulocytes , mainly [neutrophils] neutrophils . Ectoparasites include the lice Neocolpocephalum cucullare Neocolpocephalum cucullare ( [Giebel] Giebel ) and Falcolipeurus secretarius Falcolipeurus secretarius (Giebel). 
=== Breeding ===
Secretarybirds form [monogamous] monogamous pairs and defend a large territory of around 50 km (19 sq mi). They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late [dry season] dry season . During [courtship] courtship , they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with [guttural] guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a ground display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, which is also the way they defend their [territory] territory . They mate either on the ground or in trees. 
The nest is built by both sexes at the top of a dense thorny tree, often an Acacia Acacia , at a height of between 2.5 and 13 m (8 and 40 ft) above the ground. The nest is constructed as a relatively flat platform of sticks 1.0–1.5 m (3–5 ft) across with a depth 30–50 cm (12–20 in). The shallow depression is lined with grass and the occasional piece of dung. 
Eggs are laid at 2- to 3-day intervals until the clutch of 1–3 eggs is complete. The elongated chalky bluish green or white eggs average 78 mm × 57 mm (3.1 in × 2.2 in) and weigh 130 g (4.6 oz). Both parents incubate the eggs, starting as soon as the first egg is laid, but it is usually the female that remains on the nest overnight. The incubating parent greets its partner when it returns with a display of bowing and bobbing its head with neck extended. The tail is held upright with feathers fanned out, and the chest feathers are puffed out. 
The eggs hatch after around 45 days at intervals of 2–3 days. Both parents feed the young. The adults regurgitate food onto the floor of the nest and then pick up items and pass them to the chicks. For the first 2 or 3 weeks after the eggs hatch the parents take turns to stay at the nest with the young. Despite the difference in nestling size due to the asynchronous hatching, little sibling aggression has been observed. Under favourable conditions all chicks from a clutch of three eggs [fledge] fledge , but if food is scarce one or more of the chicks will die from starvation. The young may be preyed upon by [crows] crows , [ravens] ravens , [hornbills] hornbills , and large [owls] owls . 
The young are born covered in grey-white [down] down that becomes darker grey after two weeks. Their bare facial skin and legs are yellow. Crest feathers appear at 21 days, and flight feathers by 28 days. They can stand up and feed autonomously after 40 days, although the parents still feed the nestlings after that time. At 60 days, the now fully-feathered young start to flap their wings. Their weight gain over this period changes from 56 g (2.0 oz) at hatching, to 500 g (18 oz) at 20 days, 1.1 kg (2.4 lb) at 30 days, 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) at 40 days, 2 kg (4.4 lb) at 50 days, 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) at 60 days, and 3 kg (6.6 lb) at 70 days. The time they leave the nest can be anywhere between 65 and 106 days of age, although it most typically occurs between 75 and 80 days of age. Fledging is accomplished by jumping out of the nest or using a semi-controlled glide to the ground. 
Juveniles remain in their natal range before dispersing when they are between 4 and 7 months of age. The usual age at which they first breed is uncertain but there is a record of a male bird breeding successfully at an age of 2 years and 9 months, which is young for a large raptor. 
=== Food and feeding ===
Unlike most [birds of prey] birds of prey , the secretarybird is largely [terrestrial] terrestrial , hunting its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as loose familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides. Prey may consist of [insects] insects such as [locusts] locusts , other [grasshoppers] grasshoppers , [wasps] wasps , and [beetles] beetles , but small vertebrates often form main biomass. Secretarybirds are known to hunt [rodents] rodents , [frogs] frogs , [lizards] lizards , small [tortoises] tortoises , and birds such as [warblers] warblers , [larks] larks , [doves] doves , small [hornbills] hornbills , and [domestic chickens] domestic chickens . They occasionally prey on larger mammals such as [hedgehogs] hedgehogs , [mongooses] mongooses , small [felids] felids such as [cheetah] cheetah cubs, [striped polecats] striped polecats , young [gazelles] gazelles , and both young and full-grown [hares] hares . The importance of snakes in the diet has been exaggerated in the past, although they can be locally important, and venomous species such as [adders] adders and [cobras] cobras are regularly among the types of snakes preyed upon. Secretarybirds do not eat [carrion] carrion , though they occasionally eat dead animals killed in grass or bushfires. 
The birds often flush prey from tall grass by stomping on the surrounding vegetation. Their crest feathers may raise during a hunt, which may serve to help scare the target and provide shade for the face. A bird will chase after prey with the wings spread and kill by striking with swift blows of the feet. Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick them directly. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will hold down a food item with their feet while tearing it apart with their bill. 
Food that cannot be digested is regurgitated as pellets 40–45 mm (1.6–1.8 in) in diameter and 30–100 mm (1.2–3.9 in) in length. These are dropped on the ground usually near the roost or nest trees. The secretarybird has a relatively short digestive tract in comparison to large African birds with more mixed diets, such as the [kori bustard] kori bustard . The [foregut] foregut is specialised for the consumption of large amounts of meat and there is little need for the mechanical breakdown of food. The [crop] crop is dilated and the [gizzard] gizzard is nonmuscular, as in other carnivorous birds. The large intestine has a pair of vestigial [ceca] ceca as there is no requirement for the fermentative digestion of plant material. 
Secretarybirds specialise in stomping their prey until it is killed or immobilised. This method of hunting is commonly applied to lizards or snakes. An adult male trained to strike at a rubber snake on a force plate was found to hit with a force equal to five times its own body weight, with a contact period of only 10–15 milliseconds. This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping and striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. Ecophysiologist Steve Portugal and colleagues have hypothesised that the extinct [Phorusrhacidae] Phorusrhacidae (terror birds) may have employed a similar hunting technique to secretarybirds because they are [anatomically similar] anatomically similar , although they are not closely related. 
Secretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, except in the case of [tawny eagles] tawny eagles , which will [steal their kills] steal their kills . Eagles mainly steal larger prey and will attack secretarybirds both singly or in pairs. Secretarybird pairs are sometimes successful in driving the eagles away and may even knock them down and pin them to the ground. 
== Relationship with humans ==
=== Cultural significance ===
The secretarybird is depicted on an ivory knife handle recovered from Abu Zaidan in [Upper Egypt] Upper Egypt , dating to the [Naqada III] Naqada III culture (c. 3,200 BC). This and other knife handles indicate the secretarybird most likely occurred historically further north along the Nile. 
The secretarybird has traditionally been admired in Africa for its striking appearance and ability to deal with pests and snakes.  As such it has often not been disturbed, although this is changing as traditional observances have declined. It is a prominent feature on the [coat of arms of South Africa] coat of arms of South Africa , which was adopted in 2000. With its wings outstretched, it represents growth, and its penchant for killing snakes is symbolic as the protector of the South African state against enemies. It is on the [emblem of Sudan] emblem of Sudan , adopted in 1969. It is featured on the Sudanese presidential flag and presidential seal. The secretarybird has been a common [motif] motif for African countries on [postage stamps] postage stamps : over a hundred stamps from 37 issuers are known, including some from [stamp-issuing entities] stamp-issuing entities such as [Ajman] Ajman , [Manama] Manama , and the [Maldives] Maldives , regions where the bird does not exist, as well as the [United Nations] United Nations . 
The [Maasai people] Maasai people call it ol-enbai nabo ol-enbai nabo , or ""one arrow"", referring to its crest feathers. They have used parts of the bird in traditional medicine: its feathers could be burnt and the resulting smoke inhaled to treat epilepsy, its egg could be consumed with tea twice daily to treat headaches, and its fat could be boiled and drunk for child growth or livestock health. The [Xhosa people] Xhosa people call the bird inxhanxhosi inxhanxhosi and attribute great intelligence to it in folklore. The [Zulus] Zulus call it intungunono intungunono . 
The German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach proposed in 2008 that the secretarybird was recorded in the 13th-century work De arte venandi cum avibus [De arte venandi cum avibus] De arte venandi cum avibus by Holy Roman Emperor [Frederick II] Frederick II . Described as bistarda deserti bistarda deserti , it was mistaken for a [bustard] bustard . Frederick most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th-century French priest and traveller [André Thevet] André Thevet also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to this species. 
=== Threats and conservation ===
In 1968 the species became protected under the [African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources] African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources . The [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the secretarybird in 2016 as a [vulnerable species] vulnerable species and as [endangered] endangered in 2020, due to a recent rapid decline across its entire range. Although widespread, the species is thinly distributed across its range; its population has been estimated in 2016 to be anywhere between 6,700 and 67,000 individuals. Long term monitoring across South Africa between 1987 and 2013 has shown that populations have declined across the country, even in protected areas such as [Kruger National Park] Kruger National Park due to [woody plant encroachment] woody plant encroachment , an increase in the tall vegetation cover, resulting in loss of open habitat that the species prefers. 
As a population, the secretarybird is mainly threatened by loss of habitat due to fragmentation by roads and development and overgrazing of grasslands by livestock. Some adaptation to altered areas has been recorded but the trend is for decline. 
=== In captivity ===
The first successful rearing of a secretarybird in captivity occurred in 1986 at the [Oklahoma City Zoo] Oklahoma City Zoo . Although secretarybirds normally build their nests in the trees in the wild, the captive birds at the zoo built theirs on the ground, which left them open to depredation by local wild mammals. To address this problem, the zoo staff removed the eggs from the nest each time they were laid so that they could be incubated and hatched at a safer location. The species has also been bred and reared in captivity at the [San Diego Zoo Safari Park] San Diego Zoo Safari Park . 
In June 2024, a secretarybird chick was successfully hatched at [Longleat Safari Park] Longleat Safari Park in [Wiltshire] Wiltshire , born to parents Janine and Kevin, who have lived at the park since 2018. The chick’s sex is not yet known, and keepers are providing smaller food items for the protective parents. This successful hatch is seen as a promising step towards establishing a new breeding program for the species at the park.

Shoebill,Shoebill,"
The shoebill shoebill ( Balaeniceps rex Balaeniceps rex Balaeniceps rex ), also known as the whale-headed stork whale-headed stork , and shoe-billed stork shoe-billed stork , is a large long-legged wading bird. It derives its name from its enormous shoe-shaped [bill] bill . It has a somewhat [stork] stork -like overall form and has previously been classified with the storks in the order [Ciconiiformes] Ciconiiformes based on this morphology. However, genetic evidence places it with [pelicans] pelicans and [herons] herons in the [Pelecaniformes] Pelecaniformes . The adult is mainly grey while the juveniles are more brown. It lives in tropical [East Africa] East Africa in large swamps from South Sudan to Zambia.
== Taxonomy ==
The shoebill may have been known to [Ancient Egyptians] Ancient Egyptians but was not classified until the 19th century, after skins and eventually live specimens were brought to Europe. [John Gould] John Gould very briefly described it in 1850 from the skin of a specimen collected on the upper [White Nile] White Nile by the English traveller [Mansfield Parkyns] Mansfield Parkyns . Gould provided a more detailed description in the following year. He placed the species in its own [genus] genus  Balaeniceps Balaeniceps and coined the [binomial name] binomial name  Balaeniceps rex Balaeniceps rex . The genus name comes from the [Latin] Latin words balaena balaena ""whale"", and caput caput ""head"", abbreviated to -ceps -ceps in compound words. Alternative common names are whalebill, shoe-billed stork and whale-headed stork. 
Traditionally considered as allied with the [storks] storks ( [Ciconiiformes] Ciconiiformes ), it was retained there in the [Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy] Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy which lumped a massive number of unrelated taxa into their ""Ciconiiformes"". Based on osteological evidence, the suggestion of a pelecaniform affinity was made in 1957 by Patricia Cottam. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of shoebills closely resembled those of other [Pelecaniformes] Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells. In 2003, the shoebill was again suggested as closer to the [pelicans] pelicans (based on anatomical comparisons) or the [herons] herons (based on biochemical evidence). A 2008 DNA study reinforces their membership among the Pelecaniformes. 
So far, two fossilized relatives of the shoebill have been described: Goliathia [Goliathia] Goliathia from the [Early Oligocene] Early Oligocene of [Egypt] Egypt and Paludiavis [Paludiavis] Paludiavis from the [Late Miocene] Late Miocene of [Pakistan] Pakistan and [Tunisia] Tunisia . It has been suggested that the enigmatic African fossil bird Eremopezus [Eremopezus] Eremopezus have features resembling those of the shoebill and the secretary bird. 
== Description ==
The shoebill is a tall bird, with a typical height range of 110 to 140 cm (43 to 55 in) and some specimens reaching as much as 152 cm (60 in). Length from tail to beak can range from 100 to 140 cm (39 to 55 in) and wingspan is 230 to 260 cm (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Weight has reportedly ranged from 4 to 7 kg (8.8 to 15.4 lb). A male will weigh on average around 5.6 kg (12 lb) and is larger than a typical female of 4.9 kg (11 lb). The signature feature of the species is its huge, bulbous [bill] bill , which is straw-coloured with erratic greyish markings. The [exposed culmen] exposed culmen (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is 18.8 to 24 cm (7.4 to 9.4 in), the third longest bill among extant birds after  pelicans and large storks, and can outrival the pelicans in bill circumference, especially if the bill is considered as the hard, bony keratin portion. As in the pelicans, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a [tarsus] tarsus length of 21.7 to 25.5 cm (8.5 to 10.0 in). The shoebill's feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching 16.8 to 18.5 cm (6.6 to 7.3 in) in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as herons and [cranes] cranes . The wings are broad, with a [wing chord] wing chord length of 58.8 to 78 cm (23.1 to 30.7 in), and well-adapted to [soaring] soaring . 
The plumage of adult birds is blue-grey with darker [slaty] slaty -grey [flight feathers] flight feathers . The breast presents some elongated feathers, which have dark shafts. The juvenile has a similar plumage colour, but is a darker grey with a brown tinge. When they are first born, shoebills have a more modestly-sized bill, which is initially silvery-grey. The bill becomes more noticeably large when the chicks are 23 days old and becomes well developed by 43 days. 
=== Voice ===
The shoebill is normally silent, but they perform bill-clattering displays at the nest. When engaging in these displays, adult birds have also been noted to utter a [cow] cow -like moo moo as well as high-pitched whines. Both nestlings and adults engage in bill-clattering during the nesting season as a means of communication. When young are begging for food, they call out with a sound uncannily like human hiccups. In one case, a flying adult bird was heard uttering hoarse croaks, apparently as a sign of aggression at a nearby [marabou stork] marabou stork ( Leptoptilos crumeniferus Leptoptilos crumeniferus ). 
=== Flight pattern ===
Its wings are held flat while soaring and, as in the pelicans and the storks of the genus Leptoptilos [Leptoptilos] Leptoptilos , the shoebill flies with its neck retracted. Its flapping rate, at an estimated 150 flaps per minute, is one of the slowest of any bird, with the exception of the larger stork species. The pattern is alternating flapping and gliding cycles of approximately seven seconds each, putting its gliding distance somewhere between the larger storks and the [Andean condor] Andean condor ( Vultur gryphus Vultur gryphus ). When flushed, shoebills usually try to fly no more than 100 to 500 m (330 to 1,640 ft). Long flights of the shoebill are rare, and only a few flights beyond its minimum foraging distance of 20 m (66 ft) have been recorded.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The shoebill is distributed in freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa, from southern [Sudan] Sudan and [South Sudan] South Sudan through parts of eastern [Congo] Congo , [Rwanda] Rwanda , [Uganda] Uganda , western [Tanzania] Tanzania and northern [Zambia] Zambia . The species is most numerous in the [West Nile sub-region] West Nile sub-region and South Sudan (especially the [Sudd] Sudd , a main stronghold for the species); it is also significant in wetlands of Uganda and western Tanzania. More isolated records have been reported of shoebills in [Kenya] Kenya , the [Central African Republic] Central African Republic , northern [Cameroon] Cameroon , south-western [Ethiopia] Ethiopia , and [Malawi] Malawi . Vagrant strays to the [Okavango Basin] Okavango Basin , [Botswana] Botswana and the upper [Congo River] Congo River have also been sighted. The distribution of this species seems to largely coincide with that of [papyrus] papyrus and [lungfish] lungfish . They are often found in areas of flood plain interspersed with undisturbed papyrus and reedbeds. When shoebill storks are in an area with deep water, a bed of floating vegetation is a requirement. They are also found where there is poorly oxygenated water. This causes the fish living in the water to surface for air more often, increasing the likelihood a shoebill stork will successfully capture it. The shoebill is non-migratory with limited seasonal movements due to habitat changes, food availability and disturbance by humans. 
[Petroglyphs] Petroglyphs from [Oued Djerat] Oued Djerat , eastern [Algeria] Algeria , show that the shoebill occurred during the [Early Holocene] Early Holocene much more to the north, in the wetlands that covered the present-day [Sahara] Sahara  [Desert] Desert at that time. 
The shoebill occurs in extensive, dense freshwater [marshes] marshes . Almost all wetlands that attract the species have undisturbed Cyperus papyrus Cyperus papyrus and [reed beds] reed beds of Phragmites [Phragmites] Phragmites and Typha [Typha] Typha . Although their distribution largely seems to correspond with the distribution of papyrus in central Africa, the species seems to avoid pure papyrus swamps and is often attracted to areas with mixed vegetation. More rarely, the species has been seen foraging in [rice fields] rice fields and flooded [plantations] plantations . 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The shoebill is noted for its slow movements and tendency to stay still for long periods, resulting in descriptions of the species as ""statue-like"". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is often attracted to poorly oxygenated waters such as swamps, marshes, and bogs  where fish frequently surface to breathe. They also seem to exhibit migratory behaviors based upon differences in the surface water level. Immature shoebills abandon nesting sites which increased in the surface water level whereas adult shoebills abandon nesting sites which decreased in surface water level. It is suggested that both adult and immature shoebills prefer nesting sites with similar surface water levels. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant [jacana] jacana , although the similarly sized and occasionally sympatric [Goliath heron] Goliath heron ( Ardea goliath Ardea goliath ) is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills, being solitary, forage at 20 m (66 ft) or more from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in [tactile] tactile hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick violent strike. However, depending on the size of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes yield prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of [hippopotamus] hippopotamus may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as submerged hippos occasionally force fish to the surface. 
=== Breeding ===
The solitary nature of shoebills extends to their breeding habits. Nests typically occur at less than three nests per square kilometre, unlike herons, [cormorants] cormorants , pelicans, and storks, which predominantly nest in colonies. The breeding pair of shoebills vigorously defends a territory of 2 to 4 km (0.77 to 1.54 sq mi) from [conspecifics] conspecifics . In the extreme north and south of the species' range, nesting starts right after the rains end. In more central regions of the range, it may nest near the end of the wet season in order for the eggs to hatch around the beginning of the following wet season. Both parents engage in building the nest on a floating platform after clearing out an area of approximately 3 m (9.8 ft) across. The large, flattish nesting platform is often partially submerged in water and can be as much as 3 m (9.8 ft) deep. The nest itself is about 1 to 1.7 m (3.3 to 5.6 ft) wide. Both the nest and platform are made of aquatic vegetation. From one to three white eggs are laid. These eggs measure 80 to 90 mm (3.1 to 3.5 in) high by 56 to 61 mm (2.2 to 2.4 in) and weigh around 164 g (5.8 oz). Incubation lasts for approximately 30 days. Both parents actively brood, shade, guard and feed the nestling, though the females are perhaps slightly more attentive. Shoebills use their mandibles to cool their eggs with water during days with high temperatures around 30–33 °C (86–91 °F). They fill their mandible once, swallow the water, and fill another mandible full of water before proceeding back to their nest where they pour out the water and regurgitate the previously swallowed water onto both the nest and eggs. Food items are regurgitated whole from the gullet straight into the bill of the young. Shoebills rarely raise more than one chick but will hatch more. The younger chicks usually die and are intended as ""back-ups"" in case the eldest chick dies or is weak. Fledging is reached at around 105 days and the young birds can fly well by 112 days. However, they are still fed for possibly a month or more after this. It will take the young shoebills three years before they become fully sexually mature. 
Shoebills are elusive when nesting, so cameras must be placed to observe them from afar to collect behavioral data. There is an advantage for birds that are early breeders, as the chicks are tended for a longer period. 
=== Diet ===
Shoebills are largely [piscivorous] piscivorous but are assured predators of a considerable range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included [marbled lungfish] marbled lungfish ( Protopterus aethiopicus Protopterus aethiopicus ), [African lungfish] African lungfish ( Protopterus annectens Protopterus annectens ), and [Senegal bichir] Senegal bichir ( Polypterus senegalus Polypterus senegalus ), various Tilapia [Tilapia] Tilapia species and [catfish] catfish , the latter mainly in the genus Clarias [Clarias] Clarias . Other prey eaten by this species has included [frogs] frogs , water [snakes] snakes , [Nile monitors] Nile monitors ( Varanus niloticus Varanus niloticus ) and baby [crocodiles] crocodiles . More rarely, small [turtles] turtles , [snails] snails , [rodents] rodents , small [waterfowl] waterfowl and [carrion] carrion have reportedly been eaten. 
Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill, and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than is taken by other large wading birds. In the [Bangweulu Swamps] Bangweulu Swamps of Zambia, fish eaten by this species are commonly in the range of 15 to 50 cm (5.9 to 19.7 in). The main prey items fed to young by the parents were the catfish Clarias gariepinus [Clarias gariepinus] Clarias gariepinus , ( [syn.] syn.  C. mossambicus C. mossambicus ) and 50 to 60 cm (20 to 24 in) long water snakes. In Uganda, lungfish and catfish were mainly fed to the young. Larger lungfish and catfish were taken in Malagarasi wetlands in western Tanzania. During this study, fish around 60 to 80 cm (24 to 31 in) were quite frequently taken and the largest fish caught by the shoebill was 99 cm long. Fish exceeding 60 cm were usually cut into sections and swallowed at intervals. The entire process from scooping to swallowing ranged from 2 to 30 minutes depending on prey size. However, these large prey are relatively hard to handle and often targeted by [African fish eagle] African fish eagle ( Icthyophaga vocifer Icthyophaga vocifer ), which frequently steal large wading bird's prey. 
== Relationship to humans ==
This species is considered to be one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by [birdwatchers] birdwatchers . They are docile with humans and show no threatening behavior. Researchers were able to observe a bird on its nest at a close distance – within 2 meters (6 ft 7 in). Shoebills are often kept in zoos, but breeding is rarely reported. Shoebills have bred successfully at [Pairi Daiza] Pairi Daiza in [Belgium] Belgium and at [Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo] Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo in Florida. 
=== Appearances in popular culture ===
Beginning in 2014 and with various interspersed surges of attention since then, the shoebill has become the subject of [internet memes] internet memes , in part due to its intimidating appearance and its tendency to stand still for long periods of time. One such example is a video of a shoebill standing in the rain whilst [staring into the camera] staring into the camera . These memes have since also appeared on the [social media] social media platform [TikTok] TikTok , bringing a comparatively unknown species of bird into [popular culture] popular culture . The shoebill also inspired the design of the Loftwing birds in the 2011 game The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword [The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword] The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword . 
== Status and conservation ==
The population is estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 individuals, the majority of which live in swamps in South Sudan, Uganda, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia. There is also a viable population in the Malagarasi wetlands in Tanzania.  [BirdLife International] BirdLife International has classified it as [Vulnerable] Vulnerable with the main threats being [habitat destruction] habitat destruction , disturbance and hunting. The bird is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( [CITES] CITES ). Habitat destruction and degradation, hunting, disturbance and illegal capture are all contributing factors to the decline of this species. Agriculture cultivation and pasture for cattle have also caused significant habitat loss. Indigenous communities that surround Shoebill habitats capture their eggs and chicks for human consumption and for trade. Frequent fires in southern Sudan and deliberate fires for grazing access contribute to habitat loss. Some swamps in Sudan are being drained for construction of a canal to control nearby waterways, causing more habitat loss.

Mudskipper,Mudskipper,"
Apocryptes [Apocryptes] Apocryptes  Apocryptodon [Apocryptodon] Apocryptodon  Boleophthalmus [Boleophthalmus] Boleophthalmus  Oxuderces [Oxuderces] Oxuderces  Parapocryptes [Parapocryptes] Parapocryptes  Periophthalmodon [Periophthalmodon] Periophthalmodon  Periophthalmus [Periophthalmus] Periophthalmus  Pseudapocryptes [Pseudapocryptes] Pseudapocryptes  Scartelaos [Scartelaos] Scartelaos  Zappa [Zappa] Zappa 
Mudskippers Mudskippers are any of the 23 extant species of [amphibious fish] amphibious fish from the [subfamily] subfamily  Oxudercinae Oxudercinae of the [goby] goby  [family] family  [Oxudercidae] Oxudercidae . They are known for their unusual body shapes, preferences for [semiaquatic] semiaquatic habitats, limited [terrestrial locomotion] terrestrial locomotion and [jumping] jumping , and the ability to survive prolonged periods of time both in and out of water.
Mudskippers can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) long, and most are a brownish green colour that ranges anywhere from dark to light. During [mating seasons] mating seasons , the males will also develop brightly coloured spots in order to attract females, which can be red, green or blue. Unlike other fish, the mudskipper's eyes protrude from the top of its flat head. Their most noticeable feature however is their side [pectoral fins] pectoral fins that are located more forward and under their elongated body. These fins are jointed and function similarly to [limbs] limbs , which allow the mudskipper to crawl from place to place. Although having the typical body form of any other gobiid fish, these front fins allow the mudskipper to actively ""skip"" across muddy surfaces (hence the [common name] common name ) and even climb low-hanging [tree branches] tree branches and [scrubs] scrubs . Mudskippers have also been found to be able to leap distances of up to 61 centimetres (24 in) by laterally flexing and pushing with their tails. 
== Taxonomy ==
Oxudercinae is sometimes classified within the [family] family Gobiidae ( [gobies] gobies ). Recent molecular studies do not support this classification, as oxudercine gobies appear to be [paraphyletic] paraphyletic relative to amblyopine gobies (Gobiidae: [Amblyopinae] Amblyopinae ), thus being included in a distinct "" Periophthalmus [Periophthalmus] Periophthalmus lineage"", together with amblyopines. Mudskippers can be defined as oxudercine gobies that are ""fully terrestrial for some portion of the daily cycle"" (character 24 in Murdy, 1989 ). This would define the species of the genera Boleophthalmus Boleophthalmus , Periophthalmodon Periophthalmodon , Periophthalmus Periophthalmus , and Scartelaos Scartelaos as ""mudskippers"". However, field observations of Zappa confluentus [Zappa confluentus] Zappa confluentus suggest that this monotypic genus should be included in the definition. 
== Behaviour ==
Mudskippers typically live in burrows in [intertidal] intertidal  [habitats] habitats , and exhibit unique adaptations to this environment that are not found in most [intertidal fishes] intertidal fishes , which typically survive the retreat of the [tide] tide by hiding under wet [seaweed] seaweed or in [tide pools] tide pools . These burrows are most often characterised by their smooth and vaulted ceilings. The way the males dig these burrows has been found to be directly linked to their ability to survive submerged in almost anoxic water. It has also been found to play a crucial role in the development of the eggs within the burrow. Mudskippers are quite active when out of water, feeding and interacting with one another, for example, to defend their [territories] territories and court potential partners. Once the male has completed digging his burrow he will resurface and will begin attempting to attract a female through assorted yet typical displays. These displays consist of body undulations, different postures and energetic movements. Once the female has made her choice she will then proceed to follow the male into the burrow where she will lay hundreds of eggs and allow them to be fertilized. After [fertilization] fertilization occurs, the period of cohabitation between the male and female is rather short. Eventually, the female will leave and it is the male that ends up guarding the egg filled burrow from predators. 
Mudskippers are amphibious. When leaving the water and moving into a more dry environment on land, they are still able to breathe using water that is trapped inside their large gill chambers. They are also able to absorb oxygen from the lining of their mouth and throat, allowing them to stay out of water for long periods of time. It has been discovered that they spend up to three quarters of their life on land. They are found in [tropical] tropical , [subtropical] subtropical , and [temperate] temperate regions, including the [Indo] Indo - [Pacific] Pacific and the [Atlantic] Atlantic coast of Africa. 
== Adaptations ==
Compared with fully aquatic gobies, these specialised fish present a range of [anatomical] anatomical and [ethological] ethological adaptations that allow them to move effectively on land as well as in the water. 
=== Terrestrial movement ===
As their name implies, these fish use their fins to move around in a series of skips.
Although mudskippers' fins do not have a joint homologous to the elbow, the joint between the radials and the fin rays serves a functionally analogous role.
The mudskipper [pectoral fin] pectoral fin differs from most [actinopterygian] actinopterygian fishes in that the [radials] radials of the mudskipper [pectoral fin] pectoral fin are elongated and protrude from the body wall. This unusual morphology creates a pectoral fin with two fin segments (the radials and the rays) and two movable hinge joints: a 'shoulder' joint where the [cleithrum] cleithrum meets the radials and an 'intra-fin' joint where the radials meet the rays. In addition, ... the [abductor] abductor superficialis muscle of the pectoral fin is divided into two sections (rather than being a single muscle, as is common with the rest of the [Oxudercinae] Oxudercinae gobies) with one section inserting on the [dorsal] dorsal rays and the other section inserting on the [ventral] ventral rays.
=== Breathing ===
Mudskippers have the ability to breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth (the [mucosa] mucosa ) and throat (the [pharynx] pharynx ); this is only possible when the mudskippers are wet, limiting them to humid habitats and requiring that they keep themselves moist. The ability to breathe through their skin is associated with increased capillary density in their skin. This mode of breathing, similar to that employed by [amphibians] amphibians , is known as [cutaneous respiration] cutaneous respiration . Another important adaptation that aids breathing while out of water is their enlarged gill chambers, where they retain a bubble of air. These chambers close tightly when the fish is above water, due to a ventromedial valve of the gill slit, keeping the gills moist, and allowing them to function while exposed to air. Gill filaments are stiff and do not coalesce when out of water. 
=== Diet ===
The different species have adapted to various diets on the mudflats. Boleophthalmus boddarti [Boleophthalmus boddarti] Boleophthalmus boddarti is [detritivorous] detritivorous , while others will eat small crabs, insects, snails and even other mudskippers. 
=== Burrowing ===
Digging deep burrows in soft sediments allows the fish to [thermoregulate] thermoregulate , avoid marine predators during the high [tide] tide when the fish and burrow are submerged, and lay their eggs. When the burrow is submerged, several mudskipper species maintain an air pocket inside it, which allows them to breathe in conditions of very low oxygen concentration. 
=== Ammonia regulation ===
To reduce toxic ammonia production, mudskippers can suppress amino acid breakdown when exposed to air. Another method they use involves the partial breakdown of amino acids leading to the production of alanine, which also reduces ammonia production. 
Mudskippers can reduce the membrane permeability of their skin and acidify the water in their burrows to reduce levels of ammonia from the environment. 
=== Blinking ===
Mudskippers evolved the ability to [blink] blink  [independently] independently from terrestrial [tetrapods] tetrapods . Their eyes are located high on their head compared to other gobies, and they blink by lowering their eyes as a membrane called the dermal cup rises to cover them. Although other fully aquatic goby species do not have the ability to blink, mudskippers did not evolve different muscles or glands to blink with; their blinking is accomplished with the same muscles in a different configuration. Rather than having specialized glands to produce eye lubricant, the fluid film on their cornea is likely composed of mucus secreted by their skin and water from their environment, possibly stored in the infraorbital space behind the dermal cup membrane. Mudskippers likely evolved blinking in response to conditions of terrestrial life, such as to keep their eyes wet out of water (they blink more frequently in high evaporation conditions and only when colliding with things in water) and to clean and protect the eye from debris, which may adhere to the eye or approach at a faster, more dangerous speed when in air versus when in water. Their eyes are not elevated when they are still juveniles, which are fully aquatic. 
== Species ==
The [genus] genus  Periophthalmus Periophthalmus is by far the most diverse and widespread genus of mudskipper. Eighteen species have been [described] described .  Periophthalmus argentilineatus [Periophthalmus argentilineatus] Periophthalmus argentilineatus is one of the most widespread and well-known species. It can be found in [mangrove] mangrove  [ecosystems] ecosystems and [mudflats] mudflats of [East Africa] East Africa and [Madagascar] Madagascar east through the [Sundarbans] Sundarbans of [Bengal] Bengal , [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia to [Northern Australia] Northern Australia , southeast [China] China , [Taiwan] Taiwan , and the [Ryukyus] Ryukyus , to [Samoa] Samoa and [Tonga] Tonga Islands. It grows to a length of about 9.5 cm and is a [carnivorous] carnivorous opportunist feeder. It feeds on small prey such as small [crabs] crabs and other [arthropods] arthropods . However, a recent molecular study suggests that P. argentilineatus P. argentilineatus is in fact a complex of species, with at least three separate lineages, one in East Africa, and two in the Indo-Malayan region. Another species, Periophthalmus barbarus [Periophthalmus barbarus] Periophthalmus barbarus , is the only oxudercine goby that inhabits the coastal areas of western Africa.

Vampire Squid,Vampire squid,"
The vampire squid vampire squid ( Vampyroteuthis infernalis Vampyroteuthis infernalis Vampyroteuthis infernalis , lit. 'vampire squid from hell') is a small [cephalopod] cephalopod found throughout temperate and tropical oceans in extreme [deep sea] deep sea conditions. The vampire squid uses its [bioluminescent] bioluminescent organs and its unique oxygen metabolism to thrive in the parts of the ocean with the lowest concentrations of oxygen. It has two long retractile filaments, located between the first two pairs of arms on its dorsal side, which distinguish it from both [octopuses] octopuses and [squids] squids , and places it in its own order, [Vampyromorphida] Vampyromorphida , although its closest relatives are octopods. As a [phylogenetic] phylogenetic  [relict] relict , it is the only known surviving member of its order. 
The first specimens were collected on the [Valdivia Expedition] Valdivia Expedition and were originally [described] described as an octopus in 1903 by German [teuthologist] teuthologist  [Carl Chun] Carl Chun , but later assigned to a new order together with several extinct [taxa] taxa .
== Discovery ==
The vampire squid was discovered during the Valdivia Expedition (1898–1899), led by Carl Chun. Chun was a zoologist who was inspired by the [Challenger Expedition] Challenger Expedition , and wanted to verify that life does indeed exist below 300 fathoms (550 meters). Chun later classified the vampire squid into its family, [Vampyroteuthidae] Vampyroteuthidae . This expedition was funded by the German society Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte [Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte] Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte , a group of German scientists who believed there was life at depths greater than 550 meters, contrary to the [Abyssus theory] Abyssus theory . [Valdivia] Valdivia Valdivia was fitted with equipment for the collection of deep-sea organisms, as well as laboratories and specimen jars, in order to analyze and preserve what was caught. The voyage began in Hamburg, Germany, followed by Edinburgh, and then traced around the west coast of Africa. After navigating around the southern point of Africa, the expedition studied deep areas of the Indian and Antarctic Ocean. Researchers had not before discovered any species from this family that could be traced back to the Cenozoic. This suggests two ideas which are: a notable preservation bias called the [Lazarus effect] Lazarus effect may exist; or an inaccurate determination of when vampire squids originally settled in the deep oceans. The Lazarus effect may result from the scarcity of post-Cretaceous research regions or from the reduced abundance and distribution of vampire squids. In any case, even while the search regions remain the same, it is more difficult to locate and analyze them. 
== Description ==
The vampire squid can reach a maximum total length around 30 cm (1 ft). Its 15-centimetre (5.9 in) gelatinous body varies in colour from velvety jet-black to pale reddish, depending on location and lighting conditions. A webbing of skin connects its eight arms, each lined with rows of fleshy spines or [cirri] cirri ; the inner side of this ""cloak"" is black. Only the distal halves (farthest from the body) of the arms have suckers. The name of the animal was inspired by its dark colour and cloaklike webbing, rather than its habits — it feeds on [detritus] detritus , not [blood] blood . 
Its [limpid] limpid , globular eyes, which appear red or blue, depending on lighting, are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. Their large eyes are accompanied by the similarly expanded optic lobes of their brain. 
Mature adults have a pair of [small fins] small fins projecting from the lateral sides of the [mantle] mantle . These earlike fins serve as the adult's primary means of propulsion: vampire squid [move through the water] move through the water by flapping their fins. Their [beaklike jaws] beaklike jaws are white. Within the webbing are two pouches wherein the tactile velar filaments are concealed. The filaments are analogous to a true squid's [tentacles] tentacles , extending well past the [arms] arms ; but differ in origin, and represent the pair that was lost by the ancestral octopus.
The vampire squid is almost entirely covered in light-producing organs called [photophores] photophores , capable of producing disorienting flashes of light ranging in duration from fractions of a second to several minutes. The intensity and size of the photophores can also be modulated. Appearing as small, white discs, the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins, but are absent from the undersides of the caped arms. Two larger, white areas on top of the head were initially believed to also be photophores, but are now identified as [photoreceptors] photoreceptors . 
The [chromatophores] chromatophores (pigment organs) common to most [cephalopods] cephalopods are poorly developed in the vampire squid. The animal is, therefore, incapable of changing its skin colour in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods, as such an ability would not be useful at the lightless depths where it lives.
=== Systematics ===
The Vampyromorphida is the extant sister taxon to all octopuses. Phylogenetic studies of cephalopods using multiple genes and mitochondrial genomes have shown that the Vampyromorphida are the first group of [Octopodiformes] Octopodiformes to evolutionarily diverge from all others. The Vampyromorphida is characterized by derived characters such as the possession of photophores and of two velar filaments which are most probably modified arms. It also shares the inclusion of an internal [gladius] gladius with other [coleoids] coleoids , including squid, and eight webbed arms with [cirrate] cirrate octopods.
Vampyroteuthis Vampyroteuthis shares its eight cirrate arms with the Cirrata, in which lateral cirri, or filaments, alternate with the suckers. Vampyroteuthis Vampyroteuthis differs in that suckers are present only on the distal half of the arms while cirri run the entire length. In cirrate octopods suckers and cirri run and alternate on the entire length. Also, a close relationship between Vampyroteuthis Vampyroteuthis and the Jurassic-Cretaceous [Loligosepiina] Loligosepiina is indicated by the similarity of their gladii, the internal stiffening structure. Vampyronassa rhodanica [Vampyronassa rhodanica] Vampyronassa rhodanica from the middle Jurassic [La Voulte-sur-Rhône] La Voulte-sur-Rhône of France is considered as one of a vampyroteuthid that shares some characters with Vampyroteuthis Vampyroteuthis . 
The supposed vampyromorphids from the [Kimmeridgian] Kimmeridgian - [Tithonian] Tithonian (156–146 mya) of [Solnhofen] Solnhofen , Plesioteuthis prisca [Plesioteuthis prisca] Plesioteuthis prisca , Leptotheuthis gigas [Leptotheuthis gigas] Leptotheuthis gigas , and Trachyteuthis hastiformis [Trachyteuthis hastiformis] Trachyteuthis hastiformis , cannot be positively assigned to this group; they are large species (from 35 cm in P. prisca P. prisca to > 1 m in L. gigas L. gigas ) and show features not found in vampyromorphids, being somewhat similar to the true squids, [Teuthida] Teuthida . 
== Biology ==
The vampire squid's [worldwide range] worldwide range is confined to the [tropics] tropics and [subtropics] subtropics . This species is an extreme example of a [deep sea] deep sea cephalopod, thought to reside at [aphotic] aphotic (lightless) depths from 600 to 900 metres (2,000 to 3,000 ft) or more. Within this region of the world's oceans is a discrete [habitat] habitat known as the [oxygen minimum zone] oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Within an OMZ, the [saturation] saturation of [oxygen] oxygen is too low to support aerobic [metabolism] metabolism in most complex organisms. The vampire squid is the only cephalopod able to live its entire life cycle in the minimum zone, at [oxygen saturations] oxygen saturations as low as 3%.
What behavioral data is known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with [remotely operated underwater vehicles] remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV). Vampire squid are frequently injured during capture, and can survive up to two months in [aquaria] aquaria . It has been hypothesized that they can live for over eight years. 
To cope with life in the suffocating depths, vampire squids have developed several adaptations: Of all deep-sea cephalopods, their mass-specific [metabolic rate] metabolic rate is the lowest. Their blue blood's [hemocyanin] hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen more efficiently than in other cephalopods, aided by [gills] gills possessing an especially large surface area. The animals have weak musculature and a greatly [reduced shell] reduced shell , but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort because of sophisticated [statocysts] statocysts (balancing organs akin to a human's [inner ear] inner ear ) and [ammonium] ammonium -rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the [density] density of the surrounding seawater. The vampire squid's ability to thrive in OMZs also keeps it safe from [apex predators] apex predators that require a large amount of oxygen to live. 
The vampire squid's large eyes and optic lobes (of their brain) may be an adaptation for greater sensitivity to distant bioluminescence; signs of animals, such as prey aggregations or potential mates. This sensitivity is useful when monitoring a vast area of the [water column] water column , which is largely featureless at these depths. 
=== Antipredator behavior ===
Like many deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid lacks [ink] ink sacs. This, along with their low metabolic rate, lead to it adapting various alternate methods of defence. If disturbed, it will curl its arms up outwards and wrap them around its body, turning itself inside-out in a way, making itself seem larger and exposing the spiny projections on its tentacles (the cirri). The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented, concealing most of the body's photophores. The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal's head, diverting attack away from critical areas. This [anti-predator behavior] anti-predator behavior is dubbed the ""pumpkin"" or ""pineapple"" posture. The armtips [regenerate] regenerate , so if they are bitten off, they can serve as a diversion allowing the animal to escape while its predator is distracted. 
If highly agitated, it may eject a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light from its arm tips. This luminous barrage, which may last nearly 10 minutes, would presumably serve to dazzle would-be predators and allow the vampire squid to disappear into the dark without the need to swim far. The glowing ""ink"" is also able to stick to the predator, creating what is called the ""burglar alarm effect"" (making the vampire squid's would-be predator more visible to secondary predators, similar to the [Atollajellyfish] Atolla Atolla jellyfish 's light display). The display is made only if the animal is very agitated, due to the metabolic cost of mucus regeneration.
Their aforementioned bioluminescent ""fireworks"" are combined with the writhing of glowing arms, along with erratic movements and escape trajectories, making it difficult for a predator to identify the squid itself among multiple sudden targets. The vampire squid's retractile filaments have been suggested to play a larger role in predator avoidance via both detection and escape mechanisms. 
Despite these defence mechanisms, vampire squids have been found among the stomach contents of large [deepwater fish] deepwater fish , including [giant grenadiers] giant grenadiers , and deep-diving mammals, such as [whales] whales and [sea lions] sea lions .
=== Feeding ===
Vampire squid have eight arms but lack feeding tentacles (like octopods), and instead use two retractile filaments in order to capture food. These filaments have small hairs on them, made up of many sensory cells, that help them detect and secure their prey. They combine waste with mucus secreted from the suckers to form balls of food. As [sedentary] sedentary generalist feeders, they feed on detritus, including the remains of [gelatinous zooplankton] gelatinous zooplankton (such as [salps] salps , [larvaceans] larvaceans , and medusae [jellies] jellies ) and complete crustaceans, such as [copepods] copepods , [ostracods] ostracods , [amphipods] amphipods , and [isopods] isopods , as well as faecal pellets of other aquatic organisms that live above. Vampire squids also use a unique luring method where they purposefully agitate [bioluminescent protists] bioluminescent protists in the water as a way to attract larger prey for them to consume. 
=== Life cycle ===
If hypotheses may be drawn from knowledge of other deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs, or a [K-selected] K-selected strategy. Ovulation is irregular and there is minimal energy devotion into the development of the gonad. Growth is slow, as nutrients are not abundant at depths frequented by the animals. The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make reproductive encounters a fortuitous event.  With iteroparity often seen in organisms with high adult survival rates, such as the vampire squid, many low-cost reproductive cycles would be expected for the species. 
Reproduction of the vampire squid is unlike any other coleoid cephalopod; the males pass a ""packet"" of sperm to a female and the female accepts it and stores it in a special pouch inside her mantle. The female may store a male's hydraulically implanted [spermatophore] spermatophore for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs. Once she does, she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch. Their reproductive strategy appears to be [iteroparous] iteroparous , which is an exception amongst the otherwise semelparous [Coleoidea] Coleoidea . During their life, coleoid cephalopods are thought to go through only one reproductive cycle whereas vampire squid have shown evidence of multiple reproductive cycles. After releasing their eggs, new batches of eggs are formed after the female vampire squid returns to resting. This process may repeat up to, and sometimes more than, twenty times in their lifespan. These spawning events happen quite far apart due to the vampire squid's low metabolic rate. 
Few specifics are known regarding the [ontogeny] ontogeny of the vampire squid. Hatchlings are about 8 mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults, with some differences: they are transparent, their arms lack webbing, their eyes are smaller proportionally, and their velar filaments are not fully formed. Their development progresses through three morphologic forms: the very young animals have a single pair of fins, an [intermediate form] intermediate form has two pairs, and the mature form again has one pair of fins. At their earliest and intermediate phases of development, a pair of fins is located near the eyes; as the animal develops, this pair gradually disappears as the other pair develops. As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops, the fins are resized and repositioned to maximize gait efficiency. Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by [jet propulsion] jet propulsion , mature adults prefer the more efficient means of flapping their fins. This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past, with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families. 
The hatchlings survive on a generous internal [yolk] yolk supply for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed. The younger animals frequent much deeper waters, perhaps feeding on [marine snow] marine snow (falling organic detritus). The mature vampire squid is also thought to be an opportunistic hunter of larger prey as fish bones, other squid flesh, and gelatinous matter has been recorded in mature vampire squid stomachs. 
== Relationship with humans ==
=== Conservation status ===
The vampire squid is currently not on any endangered or threatened species list and they have no known impact on humans. Vampire squids are at increased risk for micro [plastic pollution] plastic pollution because their diet is mostly [marine snow] marine snow .  [Micro plastics] Micro plastics can cause death by decreasing feeding activity as they take up space in the digestive tract causing the animal's stomach to feel full without providing nutrients. 
=== Popular culture ===
Following an article in Rolling Stone [Rolling Stone] Rolling Stone magazine by [Matt Taibbi] Matt Taibbi after the [subprime mortgage crisis] subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, the term ""vampire squid"" has been regularly used in popular culture to refer to [Goldman Sachs] Goldman Sachs , the American [investment bank] investment bank . 
Live vampire squids are shown in the ""Ocean Deep"" episode of Planet Earth [Planet Earth] Planet Earth . 
The [Monterey Bay Aquarium] Monterey Bay Aquarium (California, United States) became the first facility to put this species on display, in May 2014. 
Vampire Squids are a species that can be caught and cooked in the 2023 video game Dave the Diver [Dave the Diver] Dave the Diver .

Harpy Eagle,Harpy eagle,"
The harpy eagle harpy eagle ( Harpia harpyja Harpia harpyja Harpia harpyja ) is a large [neotropical] neotropical species of [eagle] eagle . It is also called the American harpy eagle American harpy eagle to distinguish it from the [Papuan eagle] Papuan eagle , which is sometimes known as the [New Guinea harpy eagle] New Guinea harpy eagle or Papuan harpy eagle. It is the largest [bird of prey] bird of prey throughout its range, and among the largest [extant] extant species of eagles in the world. It usually inhabits tropical lowland [rainforests] rainforests in the upper (emergent) [canopy] canopy layer. Destruction of its natural [habitat] habitat has caused it to vanish from many parts of its former range, and it is nearly [extirpated] extirpated from much of [Central America] Central America . The [genus] genus  Harpia Harpia , together with Harpyopsis [Harpyopsis] Harpyopsis , Macheiramphus [Macheiramphus] Macheiramphus and Morphnus [Morphnus] Morphnus , form the subfamily [Harpiinae] Harpiinae .
== Taxonomy ==
The harpy eagle was first described by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 [10th edition ofSystema Naturae] 10th edition of Systema Naturae Systema Naturae as Vultur harpyja Vultur harpyja , after the mythological beast [harpy] harpy . It is now the only species placed in the genus Harpia Harpia that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist [Louis Pierre Vieillot] Louis Pierre Vieillot . The harpy eagle is most closely related to the [crested eagle] crested eagle ( Morphnus guianensis Morphnus guianensis ), the [Papuan eagle] Papuan eagle ( Harpyopsis novaeguineae Harpyopsis novaeguineae ) and the [bat hawk] bat hawk ( Macheiramphus alcinus Macheiramphus alcinus ), the four composing the subfamily [Harpiinae] Harpiinae within the large family [Accipitridae] Accipitridae . Previously thought to be closely related, the [Philippine eagle] Philippine eagle has been shown by [DNA analysis] DNA analysis to belong elsewhere in the [raptor] raptor family, as it is related to the [Circaetinae] Circaetinae . 
The [specific] specific name harpyja harpyja and the word ""harpy"" in the common name  both come from [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek  harpyia harpyia ( ἅρπυια [ἅρπυια] ἅρπυια ). They refer to the [harpies] harpies of Ancient [Greek mythology] Greek mythology . These were wind spirits who flew the dead to [Hades] Hades or [Tartarus] Tartarus , purported to have the lower body and talons of a raptor and the head of a woman, standing anywhere from the height of a tall child to as high as a grown man; some depictions have the creatures possessing an eagle-like body with the exposed breasts of an elderly female human, a giant wingspan and the head of a grotesque, sharp-toothed, mutant eagle—something more akin to a [goblin] goblin with wings. 
== Description ==
The upperside of the harpy eagle is covered with slate-black [feathers] feathers , and the underside is mostly white, except for the feathered [tarsi] tarsi , which are striped black. A broad black band across the upper breast separates the gray head from the white belly. The head is pale grey, and is crowned with a double crest. The upperside of the tail is black with three gray bands, while the underside of it is black with three white bands. The irises are gray or brown or red, the cere and bill are black or blackish and the tarsi and toes are yellow. The [plumage] plumage of males and females is identical. The [tarsus] tarsus is up to 13 cm (5.1 in) long. 
Female harpy eagles typically weigh 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb). One source states that adult females can weigh up to 10 kg (22 lb). An exceptionally large captive female, ""Jezebel"", weighed 12.3 kg (27 lb). Being captive, however, this large female may not be representative of the weight possible in wild harpy eagles due to differences in the food availability. The male, in comparison, is much smaller and may range in weight from 4 to 6 kg (8.8 to 13.2 lb). The average weight of adult males has been reported as 4.4 to 4.8 kg (9.7 to 10.6 lb) against an average of 7.3 to 8.3 kg (16 to 18 lb) for adult females, a 35% or higher difference in mean body mass. Harpy eagles may measure from 86.5 to 107 cm (34.1 to 42.1 in) in total length and have a wingspan of 176 to 224 cm (69 to 88 in). Among the standard measurements, the [wing chord] wing chord measures 54–63 cm (21–25 in), the tail measures 37–42 cm (15–17 in), the tarsus is 11.4–13 cm (4.5–5.1 in) long, and the [exposed culmen from the cere] exposed culmen from the cere (the beak) is 4.2 to 6.5 cm (1.7 to 2.6 in). Mean talon size is 8.6 cm (3.4 in) in males, and 12.3 cm (4.8 in) in females. 
It is sometimes cited as the largest eagle alongside the Philippine eagle, which is somewhat longer on average (between sexes averaging 100 cm (39 in)) but weighs slightly less, and the [Steller's sea eagle] Steller's sea eagle , which is perhaps slightly heavier on average (mean of three unsexed birds was 7.75 kg (17.1 lb)). 
The harpy eagle may be the largest bird species to reside in Central America, though large [water birds] water birds such as [American white pelicans] American white pelicans ( Pelecanus erythrorhynchos Pelecanus erythrorhynchos ) and [jabirus] jabirus ( Jabiru mycteria Jabiru mycteria ) have scarcely lower mean body masses. The wingspan of the harpy eagle is relatively small, though the wings are quite broad, an adaptation that increases maneuverability in forested habitats and is shared by other raptors in similar habitats. The wingspan of the harpy eagle is surpassed by several large eagles that live in more open habitats, such as those in the Haliaeetus [Haliaeetus] Haliaeetus and Aquila [Aquila] Aquila genera. The extinct [Haast's eagle] Haast's eagle was significantly larger than all extant eagles, including the harpy. 
This species is largely silent away from the nest. There, the adults give a penetrating, weak, melancholy scream, with the incubating males' call described as ""whispy screaming or wailing"". The females' calls while incubating are similar, but are lower-pitched. While approaching the nest with food, the male calls out ""rapid chirps, goose-like calls, and occasional sharp screams"". Vocalization in both parents decreases as the nestlings age, while the nestlings become more vocal. The nestlings call chi-chi-chi...chi-chi-chi-chi chi-chi-chi...chi-chi-chi-chi , seemingly in alarm in response to rain or direct sunlight. When humans approach the nest, the nestlings have been described as uttering croaks, quacks, and whistles. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Relatively rare and elusive throughout its range, the harpy eagle is found from southern [México] México (incl. [Chiapas] Chiapas , [Oaxaca] Oaxaca and the [Yucatán] Yucatán states) and south through [Central America] Central America , into [South America] South America to as far south as [Argentina] Argentina . They can still be seen by tourists and locals in [Costa Rica] Costa Rica and [Panama] Panama . As their preferred habitat is rainforest, they nest and hunt predominantly in the [emergent layer] emergent layer . The eagle is most common in [Brazil] Brazil , where it is found across the entire country. With the exception of some areas of the aforementioned Panama and Costa Rica, the species is nearly extinct in [Central America] Central America , likely due to the logging industry’s decimation of much of the Meso-American rainforests. Their habitat is expected to decline further due to climate change. The harpy eagle prefers  tropical, lowland rainforests and may also choose to nest within such areas from the canopy to the emergent vegetation. They typically occur below an elevation of 900 m (3,000 ft), but have been recorded at elevations up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft). Within the forests, they hunt in the canopy or, rarely, on the ground, and perch on emergent trees to scout for prey. They do not generally occur in disturbed areas, avoiding humans whenever possible, but regularly visit semi-open forest and pasture mosaic, in hunting forays. Harpies, however, can be found flying over forest borders in a variety of habitats, such as [cerrados] cerrados , [caatingas] caatingas , [buriti] buriti palm stands, cultivated fields, and cities. They have recently been found in areas where [high-grade forestry] high-grade forestry is practiced.
== Behavior ==
=== Feeding ===
Full grown harpy eagles are at [the top] the top of a [food chain] food chain . They possess the largest [talons] talons of any living eagle and have been recorded as carrying prey weighing up to roughly half of their own [body weight] body weight . This allows them to snatch from tree branches a live sloth and other large prey items. Most commonly, harpy eagles use perch hunting, in which they scan for prey activity while briefly perched between short flights from tree to tree. Upon spotting prey, the eagle quickly dives and grabs it. Sometimes, harpy eagles are ""sit-and-wait"" predators (common in forest-dwelling raptors), perching for long periods on a high point near an opening, a river, or a [salt lick] salt lick , where many mammals go to attain nutrients. On occasion, they may also hunt by flying within or above the canopy. They have also been observed tail-chasing: pursuing another bird in flight, rapidly dodging among trees and branches, a predation style common to hawks (genus Accipiter [Accipiter] Accipiter ) that hunt birds. 
A recent literature review and research using camera traps list a total of 116 prey species. Its main prey are tree-dwelling [mammals] mammals , and a majority of the diet has been shown to focus on [sloths] sloths . Research conducted by Aguiar-Silva between 2003 and 2005 in a nesting site in [Parintins] Parintins , [Amazonas] Amazonas , [Brazil] Brazil , collected remains from prey offered to the nestling by its parents. The researchers found that 79% of the harpy's prey was accounted for by sloths from two species: 39% [brown-throated sloth] brown-throated sloth ( Bradypus variegatus Bradypus variegatus ), and 40% [Linnaeus's two-toed sloth] Linnaeus's two-toed sloth ( Choloepus didactylus Choloepus didactylus ). Similar research in Panama, where two captive-bred subadults were released, found that 52% of the male's captures and 54% of the female's were of two sloth species (brown-throated sloth and [Hoffmann's two-toed sloth] Hoffmann's two-toed sloth ( Choloepus hoffmanni Choloepus hoffmanni ). Harpy eagles are capable of hunting all size of sloths, including full-grown adult [two-toed sloths] two-toed sloths weighing up to 9 kg (20 lb). 
Another major prey of harpy eagles is [monkeys] monkeys . At several nests in [Guyana] Guyana , monkeys made up about 37% of the prey remains found at the nests. Similarly, [cebid monkeys] cebid monkeys made up 35% of the remains found at 10 nests in Amazonian Ecuador. Monkeys regularly taken include [capuchin monkeys] capuchin monkeys , [saki monkeys] saki monkeys , [howler monkeys] howler monkeys , [titi monkeys] titi monkeys , [squirrel monkeys] squirrel monkeys , and [spider monkeys] spider monkeys . Smaller monkeys, such as [tamarins] tamarins and [marmosets] marmosets , are, however, seemingly ignored as prey by this species. Small monkeys typically weighing between 1 and 4 kg (2.2 and 8.8 lb), such as [Wedge-capped capuchin] Wedge-capped capuchin ( Cebus olivaceus Cebus olivaceus ), [tufted capuchin] tufted capuchin ( Sapajus apella Sapajus apella ), and [white-faced saki] white-faced saki ( Pithecia pithecia Pithecia pithecia ) are the most frequently taken. Larger howler monkeys are also taken, mainly [Colombian red howler] Colombian red howler ( Alouatta seniculus Alouatta seniculus ), but also [Guyanan red howler] Guyanan red howler ( Alouatta macconnelli Alouatta macconnelli ) and [mantled howler] mantled howler ( Alouatta palliata Alouatta palliata ). These monkeys typically weigh between 4.4 to 8.6 kg (9.7 to 19.0 lb) and female harpy eagles can prey on all ages and sexes, while male harpy eagles tend to focus on juveniles. In one study, breeding harpy eagles hunted [Yucatán black howler] Yucatán black howler ( Alouatta pigra Alouatta pigra ), the largest howler monkey which can weigh between 6.4 and 11.3 kg (14 and 25 lb), although the ages of the monkeys taken by these eagles are unknown. Nevertheless, adults of other large monkeys can be taken by female harpy eagles, including [woolly monkey] woolly monkey ( Lagothrix cana Lagothrix cana ) and [Peruvian spider monkey] Peruvian spider monkey ( Ateles chamek Ateles chamek ), and [red-faced spider monkey] red-faced spider monkey ( Ateles paniscus Ateles paniscus ) which can weigh around 5.8 to 9.4 kg (13 to 21 lb) and possibly exceeding 10 to 11 kg (22 to 24 lb) in large males. 
Other partially arboreal and even land mammals are also preyed on given the opportunity. In the [Pantanal] Pantanal , a pair of nesting eagles preyed largely on the porcupine ( Coendou prehensilis [Coendou prehensilis] Coendou prehensilis ) and the agouti ( Dasyprocta azarae [Dasyprocta azarae] Dasyprocta azarae ). Both species of [tamanduas] tamanduas ( Tamandua mexicana Tamandua mexicana & T. tetradactyla T. tetradactyla ) are taken and [armadillos] armadillos , especially [nine-banded armadillo] nine-banded armadillo ( Dasypus novemcinctus Dasypus novemcinctus ) are also taken, as well as carnivores such as [kinkajous] kinkajous ( Potos flavus Potos flavus ), [coatis] coatis ( Nasua nasua Nasua nasua & N. narcia N. narcia ), [tayras] tayras ( Eira barbara Eira barbara ), and occasionally [margays] margays ( Leopardus wiedii Leopardus wiedii ) and [crab-eating foxes] crab-eating foxes ( Cerdocyon thous Cerdocyon thous ). In one instant, an adult [greater grison] greater grison ( Galictis vittata Galictis vittata ) was killed and partly consumed by subadult female harpy eagle. Those carnivoran prey species usually weigh around 1.4 to 7.2 kg (3.1 to 15.9 lb), but there is a report that harpy eagles prey on possibly larger carnivores such as [ocelot] ocelot ( Leopardus pardalis Leopardus pardalis ) and adult [crab-eating raccoon] crab-eating raccoon respectively. Other mammals, such as young [peccaries] peccaries , [deer] deer fawns, [squirrels] squirrels and [opossums] opossums are additionally taken. 
The eagle may also attack bird species such as [macaws] macaws : At the Parintins research site, the [red-and-green macaw] red-and-green macaw ( Ara chloropterus Ara chloropterus ) made up for 0.4% of the prey base, with other birds amounting to 4.6%. Other [parrots] parrots have also been preyed on, as well as [cracids] cracids such as [curassows] curassows and other birds like [seriemas] seriemas . In one occasion, dependent juvenile male eagle quickly learned how to hunt [black vultures] black vultures ( Coragyps atratus Coragyps atratus ) and accounted for 9 of our 10 records of harpy predation on vultures. Additional prey items reported include [reptiles] reptiles such as [iguanas] iguanas , [tegus] tegus , [snakes] snakes , and [amphisbaenids] amphisbaenids . In [Suriname] Suriname , [green iguanas] green iguanas ( Iguana iguana Iguana iguana ) can be important prey source, and predation on [yellow-footed tortoise] yellow-footed tortoise ( Chelonoidis denticulata Chelonoidis denticulata ) have been recorded twice. 
The eagle has been recorded as taking domestic livestock, including chickens, [lambs] lambs , [goats] goats , and young pigs, but this is extremely rare under normal circumstances. They control the population of [mesopredators] mesopredators such as capuchin monkeys, which prey extensively on bird's eggs and which (if not naturally controlled) may cause local extinctions of sensitive species. 
Males usually take relatively smaller prey, with a typical range of 0.5 to 2.5 kg (1.1 to 5.5 lb) or about half their own weight. The larger females take larger prey, with a minimum recorded prey weight of around 2.7 kg (6.0 lb). Adult female harpies regularly grab large male howler or spider monkeys or mature sloths weighing 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb) in flight and fly off without landing, an enormous feat of strength. Prey items taken to the nest by the parents are normally medium-sized, having been recorded from 1 to 4 kg (2.2 to 8.8 lb). The prey brought to the nest by males averaged 1.5 kg (3.3 lb), while the prey brought to the nest by females averaged 3.2 kg (7.1 lb). In another study, floaters (i.e. birds not engaging in breeding at that time) were found to take larger prey, averaging 4.24 kg (9.3 lb), than those that were nesting, for which prey averaged 3.64 kg (8.0 lb), with prey species estimated to weigh a mean of 1.08 kg (2.4 lb) (for [common opossum] common opossum ) to 10.1 kg (22 lb) (for adult [crab-eating raccoon] crab-eating raccoon ). Overall, harpy eagle  prey weigh between 0.3 and 6.5 kg (0.66 and 14.33 lb), with the mean prey size equalling 2.6 ± 0.8 kg (5.7 ± 1.8 lb) 
=== Breeding ===
In ideal habitats, nests would be fairly close together. In some parts of Panama and Guyana, active nests were located 3 km (1.9 mi) away from one another, while they are within 5 km (3.1 mi) of each other in Venezuela. In Peru, the average distance between nests was 7.4 km (4.6 mi) and the average area occupied by each breeding pairs was estimated at 4,300 ha (11,000 acres). In less ideal areas, with fragmented forest, breeding territories were estimated at 25 km (16 mi). The female harpy eagle lays two white eggs in a large stick nest, which commonly measures 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) deep and 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) across and may be used over several years. Nests are located high up in a tree, usually in the main fork, at 16 to 43 m (52 to 141 ft), depending on the stature of the local trees. The harpy often builds its nest in the crown of the [kapok tree] kapok tree , one of the tallest trees in South America. In many South American cultures,  cutting down the kapok tree is considered bad luck, which may help safeguard the habitat of this stately eagle. The bird also uses other huge trees on which to build its nest, such as the [Brazil nut tree] Brazil nut tree . A nesting site found in the Brazilian [Pantanal] Pantanal was built on a cambará cambará tree ( Vochysia divergens [Vochysia divergens] Vochysia divergens ). 
No display is known between pairs of eagles, and they are believed to mate for life. A pair of harpy eagles usually only raises one chick every 2–3 years. After the first chick hatches, the second egg is ignored and normally fails to hatch unless the first egg perishes. The egg is incubated around 56 days. When the chick is 36 days old, it can stand and walk awkwardly. The chick fledges at the age of 6 months, but the parents continue to feed it for another 6 to 10 months. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but also takes an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest. Breeding maturity is not reached until birds are 4 to 6 years of age. Adults can be aggressive toward humans who disturb the nesting site or appear to be a threat to their young. 
== Status and conservation ==
Although the harpy eagle still occurs over a considerable range, its distribution and populations have dwindled considerably. It is threatened primarily by [habitat loss] habitat loss due to the expansion of logging, cattle ranching, agriculture, and prospecting. Secondarily, it is threatened by being hunted as an actual threat to livestock and/or a supposed one to human life, due to its great size. Although not actually known to prey on humans and only rarely on domestic stock, the species' large size and nearly fearless behaviour around humans reportedly make it an ""irresistible target"" for hunters. Such threats apply throughout its range, in large parts of which the bird has become a transient sight only; in [Brazil] Brazil , it was all but wiped out from the [Atlantic rainforest] Atlantic rainforest and is only found in appreciable numbers in the most remote parts of the [Amazon basin] Amazon basin ; a Brazilian journalistic account of the mid-1990s already complained that at the time it was only found in significant numbers in Brazilian territory on the northern side of the Equator. Scientific 1990s records, however, suggest that the harpy Atlantic Forest population may be migratory. Subsequent research in Brazil has established that, as of 2009, the harpy eagle, outside the Brazilian Amazon, is critically endangered in [Espírito Santo] Espírito Santo ,  [São Paulo] São Paulo and [Paraná] Paraná , endangered in [Rio de Janeiro] Rio de Janeiro , and probably extirpated in [Rio Grande do Sul] Rio Grande do Sul (where a recent (March 2015) record was set for the [Parque Estadual do Turvo] Parque Estadual do Turvo ) and [Minas Gerais] Minas Gerais – the actual size of their total population in Brazil is unknown. 
Globally, the harpy eagle is considered [vulnerable] vulnerable by [IUCN] IUCN and threatened with extinction by [CITES] CITES (appendix I). [The Peregrine Fund] The Peregrine Fund until recently considered it a ""conservation-dependent species"", meaning it depends on a dedicated effort for captive breeding and release to the wild, as well as habitat protection, to prevent it from reaching [endangered] endangered status, but now has accepted the near threatened status. The harpy eagle is considered critically endangered in Mexico and Central America, where it has been extirpated in most of its former range; in Mexico, it used to be found as far north as [Veracruz] Veracruz , but today probably occurs only in [Chiapas] Chiapas in the [Selva Zoque] Selva Zoque . It is considered as near threatened or vulnerable in most of the South American portion of its range; at the southern extreme of its range, in Argentina, it is found only in the [Parana] Parana Valley forests at the province of [Misiones] Misiones . It has disappeared from [El Salvador] El Salvador , and almost so from [Costa Rica] Costa Rica . 
=== National initiatives ===
Various initiatives for restoration of the species are in place in various countries. Since 2002, the [Peregrine Fund] Peregrine Fund initiated a conservation and research program for the harpy eagle in the [Darién Province] Darién Province . A similar—and grander, given the dimensions of the countries involved—research project is occurring in [Brazil] Brazil , at the [National Institute of Amazonian Research] National Institute of Amazonian Research , through which 45 known nesting locations (updated to 62, only three outside the [Amazonian basin] Amazonian basin and all three inactive) are being monitored by researchers and volunteers from local communities. A harpy eagle chick has been fitted with a [radio transmitter] radio transmitter that allows it to be tracked for more than three years via a satellite signal sent to the [Brazilian National Institute for Space Research] Brazilian National Institute for Space Research . Also, a photographic recording of a nest site in the [Carajás National Forest] Carajás National Forest was made for the Brazilian edition of National Geographic Magazine [National Geographic Magazine] National Geographic Magazine . 
In Panama, the Peregrine Fund carried out a captive-breeding and release project that released a total of 49 birds in [Panama] Panama and [Belize] Belize . The [Peregrine Fund] Peregrine Fund has also carried out a research and conservation project on this species since the year 2000, making it the longest-running study on harpy eagles. 
In [Belize] Belize , the Belize Harpy Eagle Restoration Project began in 2003 with the collaboration of [Sharon Matola] Sharon Matola , founder and director of the [Belize Zoo] Belize Zoo and the [Peregrine Fund] Peregrine Fund . The goal of this project was the re-establishment of the harpy eagle within [Belize] Belize . The population of the eagle declined as a result of forest fragmentation, shooting, and nest destruction, resulting in near [extirpation] extirpation of the species. Captive-bred harpy eagles were released in the [Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area] Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in [Belize] Belize , chosen for its quality forest habitat and linkages with [Guatemala] Guatemala and [Mexico] Mexico . Habitat linkage with [Guatemala] Guatemala and [Mexico] Mexico were important for conservation of quality habitat and the harpy eagle on a regional level. As of November 2009, 14 harpy eagles have been released and are monitored by the Peregrine Fund, through satellite [telemetry] telemetry . 
In January 2009, a chick from the all-but-extirpated population in the Brazilian state of [Paraná] Paraná was hatched in captivity at the preserve kept in the vicinity of the [Itaipu Dam] Itaipu Dam by the Brazilian/Paraguayan state-owned company [Itaipu Binacional] Itaipu Binacional . In September 2009, an adult female, after being kept captive for 12 years in a private reservation, was fitted with a radio transmitter before being restored to the wild in the vicinity of the [Pau Brasil National Park] Pau Brasil National Park (formerly [Monte Pascoal] Monte Pascoal NP), in the state of [Bahia] Bahia . 
In December 2009, a 15th harpy eagle was released into the [Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area] Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in Belize. The release was set to tie in with the [United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009] United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 , in [Copenhagen] Copenhagen . The 15th eagle, nicknamed ""Hope"" by the Peregrine officials in Panama, was the ""poster child"" for forest conservation in Belize, a [developing country] developing country , and the importance of these activities in relation to [climate change] climate change . The event received coverage from [Belize] Belize 's major media entities, and was supported and attended by the [U.S. Ambassador to Belize] U.S. Ambassador to Belize , [Vinai Thummalapally] Vinai Thummalapally , and [British High Commissioner] British High Commissioner to [Belize] Belize , Pat Ashworth. 
In [Colombia] Colombia , as of 2007, an adult male and a subadult female confiscated from wildlife trafficking were restored to the wild and monitored in [Paramillo National Park] Paramillo National Park in [Córdoba] Córdoba , and another couple was being kept in captivity at a research center for breeding and eventual release. A monitoring effort with the help of volunteers from local Native American communities is also being made in [Ecuador] Ecuador , including the joint sponsorship of various Spanish universities —this effort being similar to another one going on since 1996 in [Peru] Peru , centred around a native community in the [Tambopata Province] Tambopata Province , [Madre de Dios Region] Madre de Dios Region . Another monitoring project, begun in 1992, was operating as of 2005 in the state of [Bolívar] Bolívar , [Venezuela] Venezuela . 
== In human culture ==
The harpy eagle is the [national bird] national bird of Panama and is depicted on the [coat of arms of Panama] coat of arms of Panama . The 15th harpy eagle released in Belize, named ""Hope"", was dubbed ""Ambassador for Climate Change"", in light of the [United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009] United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 . 
The bird appeared on the reverse side of the Venezuelan [Bs.F] Bs.F 2,000 note.
The harpy eagle was the inspiration behind the design of Fawkes the Phoenix in the [Harry Potter film series] Harry Potter film series . A live harpy eagle was used to portray the now-extinct [Haast's eagle] Haast's eagle in BBC's Monsters We Met [Monsters We Met] Monsters We Met . 
=== Indigenous cultures ===
In [Aztec] Aztec religion the harpy eagle was sacred to [Quetzalcoatl] Quetzalcoatl .

Lyrebird,Lyrebird,"
A lyrebird lyrebird is either of two [species] species of ground-dwelling [Australian] Australian birds that compose the genus Menura Menura Menura , and the [family] family  Menuridae Menuridae . They are most notable for their impressive ability to [mimic] mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display.  Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds.
== Taxonomy ==
The classification of lyrebirds was the subject of much debate after the first specimens reached European scientists after 1798. Based on specimens sent from [New South Wales] New South Wales to England, Major-General [Thomas Davies] Thomas Davies illustrated and described this species as the [superb lyrebird] superb lyrebird , which he called Menura superba Menura superba , in an 1800 presentation to the [Linnean Society of London] Linnean Society of London , but this work was not published until 1802; in the intervening time period, however, the species was described and named Menura novaehollandiae Menura novaehollandiae by John Latham in 1801, and this is the accepted name by virtue of [nomenclatural priority] nomenclatural priority .
The genus name Menura Menura refers to the pattern of repeated transparent crescents (or ""lunules"") on the superb lyrebird's outer tail-feathers, from the [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek words μήνη μήνη μήνη  mēnē mēnē ""moon"" and ουρά ουρά ουρά  ourá ourá ""tail"". 
Lyrebirds are named because their outer tail feathers are broad and curved in a S shape that together resemble the shape of a [lyre] lyre . 
=== Systematics ===
Lyrebirds were thought to be [Galliformes] Galliformes like the broadly similar looking [partridge] partridge , [junglefowl] junglefowl , and [pheasants] pheasants familiar to Europeans, reflected in the early names given to the superb lyrebird, including native pheasant. They were also called peacock-wrens and Australian birds-of-paradise. The idea that they were related to the pheasants was abandoned when the first chicks, which are [altricial] altricial , were described. They were not classed with the passerines until a paper was published in 1840, twelve years after they were assigned a discrete family, Menuridae. Within that family they compose a single genus, Menura Menura . 
It is generally accepted that the lyrebird family is most closely related to the [scrub] scrub -birds ( [Atrichornithidae] Atrichornithidae ) and some authorities combine both in a single family, but evidence that they are also related to the [bowerbirds] bowerbirds remains controversial. 
Lyrebirds are ancient Australian animals: the [Australian Museum] Australian Museum has fossils of lyrebirds dating back to about 15 million years ago. The prehistoric Menura tyawanoides [Menura tyawanoides] Menura tyawanoides has been described from Early [Miocene] Miocene  [fossils] fossils found at the famous [Riversleigh] Riversleigh site. 
=== Species ===
Two species of lyrebird are extant:
[] 

[] 

== Description ==
The lyrebirds are large [passerine] passerine birds, amongst the largest in the order. They are ground living birds with strong legs and feet and short rounded wings. They are poor fliers and rarely fly except for periods of downhill gliding. The superb lyrebird is the larger of the two species. Lyrebirds measure 31 to 39 inches in length, including their tail. Males tend to be slightly larger than females. Females weigh around 2 pounds, and males weigh around 2.4 pounds.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The superb lyrebird is found in areas of rainforest in [Victoria] Victoria , [New South Wales] New South Wales , and south-east [Queensland] Queensland .  It is also found in [Tasmania] Tasmania where it was introduced in the 19th century. Many superb lyrebirds live in the [Dandenong Ranges National Park] Dandenong Ranges National Park and [Kinglake National Park] Kinglake National Park around [Melbourne] Melbourne , the [Royal National Park] Royal National Park and [Illawarra] Illawarra region south of Sydney, in many other parks along the east coast of Australia, and non protected bushland. Albert's lyrebird is found only in a small area of [Southern Queensland] Southern Queensland  [rainforest] rainforest .
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Lyrebirds are shy and difficult to approach, particularly the Albert's lyrebird, with the result that little information about its behaviour has been documented. When lyrebirds detect potential danger, they pause and scan the surroundings, sound an alarm, and either flee the area on foot, or seek cover and freeze. Firefighters sheltering in mine shafts during [bushfires] bushfires have been joined by lyrebirds. 
=== Diet and feeding ===
Lyrebirds feed on the ground and as individuals. A range of invertebrate prey is taken, including [insects] insects such as [cockroaches] cockroaches , [beetles] beetles (both adults and larvae), [earwigs] earwigs , fly larvae, and the adults and larvae of moths. Other prey taken includes [centipedes] centipedes , [spiders] spiders , [earthworms] earthworms . Less commonly taken prey includes stick insects, bugs, [amphipods] amphipods , [lizards] lizards , frogs and occasionally, [seeds] seeds . They find food by scratching with their feet through the [leaf] leaf -litter. 
=== Breeding ===
Lyrebirds are long-lived birds that can live as long as 30 years. They have long breeding cycles and start breeding later in life than other passerine birds. Female superb lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males, and those territories may contain the breeding territories of up to eight females. Within the male territories, the males create or use display platforms; for the superb lyrebird, this is a mound of bare soil; for the Albert's lyrebird, it is a pile of twigs on the forest floor. 
Male lyrebirds call mostly during winter, when they construct and maintain an open arena-mound in dense [bush] bush , on which they sing and dance in an elaborate [courtship display] courtship display performed for potential mates, of which the male lyrebird has several. The strength, volume, and location of the nest built by the female lyrebird is dependent on the rainfall and predation during the nest building period. It is important for the nest to be water resistant and hidden in secluded areas so predators cannot attack. Once the nest is made in the preferred location, the female lyrebird lays a single [egg] egg . The egg is [incubated] incubated over 50 days solely by the female, and the female also fosters the chick alone.
=== Vocalizations and mimicry ===
A lyrebird's [song] song is one of the more distinctive aspects of its behavioural biology. Lyrebirds sing throughout the year, but the peak of the breeding season, from June to August, is when they sing with the most intensity. During this peak males may sing for four hours of the day, almost half the hours of daylight. The song of the lyrebird is a mixture of elements of its own song and mimicry of other species. Lyrebirds render with great fidelity the individual songs of other birds and the chatter of flocks of birds, and also mimic other animals such as possums,  [koalas] koalas and [dingoes] dingoes . Lyrebirds have been recorded mimicking human sounds such as a mill whistle, a cross-cut saw, [chainsaws] chainsaws , [car engines] car engines and [car alarms] car alarms , [fire alarms] fire alarms , [rifle] rifle -shots, [camera] camera shutters, [dogs] dogs barking, crying babies, music, mobile phone ring tones, and even the human voice. However, while the mimicry of human noises is widely reported, the extent to which it happens is exaggerated and the phenomenon is unusual. Parts of the lyrebird's own song can resemble human-made [sound effects] sound effects , which has given rise to the [urban legend] urban legend that they frequently imitate video game or film sounds. 
The superb lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including from other superb lyrebirds. An instructive example is the population of superb lyrebirds in Tasmania, which have retained the calls of species not native to Tasmania in their repertoire, with some local Tasmanian endemic bird songs added. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics capable of complex vocalisations. Superb lyrebird females are silent during courtship; however, they regularly produce sophisticated vocal displays during foraging and nest defense. A recording of a superb lyrebird mimicking sounds of an electronic shooting game, workmen and chainsaws was added to the [National Film and Sound Archive] National Film and Sound Archive 's [Sounds of Australia] Sounds of Australia registry in 2013. 
Both species of lyrebird produced elaborate lyrebird-specific vocalisations including 'whistle songs'. Males also sing songs specifically associated with their song and dance displays.
One researcher, Sydney Curtis, has recorded flute-like lyrebird calls in the vicinity of the [New England National Park] New England National Park . Similarly, in 1969, a park ranger, Neville Fenton, recorded a lyrebird song which resembled flute sounds in the New England National Park, near Dorrigo in northern coastal New South Wales. After much detective work by Fenton, it was discovered that in the 1930s, a flute player living on a farm adjoining the park used to play tunes near his pet lyrebird. The lyrebird adopted the tunes into his repertoire, and retained them after release into the park. Neville Fenton forwarded a tape of his recording to [Norman Robinson] Norman Robinson . Because a lyrebird is able to carry two tunes at the same time, Robinson filtered out one of the tunes and put it on the phonograph for the purposes of analysis. One witness suggested that the song represents a modified version of two popular tunes in the 1930s: ""The Keel Row"" and ""Mosquito's Dance"". Musicologist David Rothenberg has endorsed this information. However, a ""flute lyrebird"" research group (including Curtis and Fenton) formed to investigate the veracity of this story found no evidence of ""Mosquito Dance"" and only remnants of ""Keel Row"" in contemporary and historical lyrebird recordings from this area. Neither were they able to prove that a lyrebird chick had been a pet, although they acknowledged compelling evidence on both sides of the argument. 
== Status and conservation ==
Until the [2019–2020 Australian bushfire season] 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season , superb lyrebirds were not considered threatened in the short to medium term. Concern has since grown as early analyses have shown the extent of destruction of the lyrebird's preferred wet-forest habitats, which in less intense previous bushfire seasons have been spared, in large part due to their moisture content. Albert's lyrebird has a very restricted habitat and had been listed as [vulnerable] vulnerable by the [IUCN] IUCN , but because the species and its habitat were carefully managed, the species was re-assessed to [near threatened] near threatened in 2009. The superb lyrebird had already been seriously threatened by [habitat destruction] habitat destruction in the past. Its population had since recovered, but the 2019–2020 bushfires damaged much of its habitat, which may lead to a reclassification of its status from ""common"" to ""threatened"". Beyond this new threat are the long-term vulnerabilities to predation by [cats] cats and [foxes] foxes , as well as human population pressure on its habitat. 
== In culture ==
=== Painting by John Gould ===
The lyrebird is so called because the male bird has a spectacular tail, consisting of 16 highly modified [feathers] feathers (two long slender lyrates lyrates at the centre of the plume, two broader medians medians on the outside edges and twelve filamentaries filamentaries arrayed between them), which was originally thought to resemble a [lyre] lyre . This happened when a superb lyrebird specimen (which had been taken from Australia to [England] England during the early 19th century) was prepared for display at the [British Museum] British Museum by a [taxidermist] taxidermist who had never seen a live lyrebird. The taxidermist mistakenly thought that the tail would resemble a lyre, and that the tail would be held in a similar way to that of a [peacock] peacock during [courtship display] courtship display , and so he arranged the feathers in this way. Later, [John Gould] John Gould (who had also never seen a live lyrebird), painted the lyrebird from the British Museum specimen.
The male lyrebird's tail is not held as in John Gould's painting. Instead, the male lyrebird's tail is fanned over the lyrebird during courtship display, with the tail completely covering his head and back—as can be seen in the image in the "" [breeding] breeding "" section of this page, and also the image of the 10-cent coin, where the superb lyrebird's tail (in courtship display) is portrayed accurately.
=== Lyrebird emblems and logos ===
The lyrebird has been featured as a symbol and emblem many times, especially in [New South Wales] New South Wales and [Victoria] Victoria (where the superb lyrebird has its natural habitat), and in [Queensland] Queensland (where Albert's lyrebird has its natural habitat).

About 12; see text
Tree-kangaroos Tree-kangaroos are [marsupials] marsupials of the [genus] genus  Dendrolagus Dendrolagus Dendrolagus , adapted for [arboreal locomotion] arboreal locomotion . They inhabit the [tropical rainforests] tropical rainforests of [New Guinea] New Guinea and far northeastern [Queensland] Queensland , [Australia] Australia along with some of the islands in the region. All tree-kangaroos are considered [threatened] threatened due to hunting and [habitat destruction] habitat destruction . They are the only true arboreal [macropods] macropods . 
== Evolutionary history ==
The evolutionary history of tree-kangaroos possibly begins with a rainforest floor-dwelling [pademelon-like ancestor] pademelon-like ancestor . This ancestor possibly evolved from an arboreal [possum-like ancestor] possum-like ancestor as is suspected of all macropodid marsupials in Australia and New Guinea. During the late [Eocene] Eocene , the Australian/New Guinean continent began a period of drying that caused a retreat in the area of rainforest, which forced the ancestral [pademelons] pademelons to begin living in a drier, rockier environment. After some generations of adaptation to the new environment, the pademelons may have evolved into [rock-wallabies] rock-wallabies ( Petrogale Petrogale spp.), which developed a generalist feeding strategy due to their dependence on a diverse assortment of vegetation refuges. This generalist strategy allowed the rock-wallabies to easily adapt to [Malesian] Malesian rainforest types that were introduced to Australia from Asia during the mid-Miocene. The rock-wallabies that migrated into these introduced forests adapted to spend more time climbing trees. One species in particular, the [Proserpine rock-wallaby] Proserpine rock-wallaby ( Petrogale persephone Petrogale persephone ), displays equal preference for climbing trees as for living in rocky outcrops. During the Late Miocene, the semi-arboreal rock-wallabies could have evolved into the now extinct tree-kangaroo genus Bohra [Bohra] Bohra . Global cooling during the Pleistocene caused continent-wide drying and rainforest retractions in Australia and New Guinea. 
The rainforest contractions isolated populations of Bohra Bohra which resulted in the evolution of today's tree-kangaroos ( Dendrolagus Dendrolagus spp.), as they adapted to lifestyles in geographically small and diverse rainforest fragments, and became further specialized for a canopy-dwelling lifestyle. 
== Taxonomy ==
=== Species ===
These species are assigned to the genus Dendrolagus Dendrolagus : 
[Seri's tree-kangaroo] Seri's tree-kangaroo ( Dendrolagus stellarum Dendrolagus stellarum ) has been described as a [subspecies] subspecies of [Doria's tree-kangaroo] Doria's tree-kangaroo ( D. dorianus stellarum D. dorianus stellarum ), but some recent authorities have treated it as a separate species based on its absolute diagnostability . 
The Wondiwoi tree-kangaroo is among the 25 ""most wanted lost"" species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation's ""Search for Lost Species"" initiative. 
The extinct species D. noibano [D. noibano] D. noibano from the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene of [Chimbu Province] Chimbu Province , Papua New Guinea is substantially larger than living species. However, it has since been suggested to be a larger extinct form of Doria's tree-kangaroo. 
The case for the [golden-mantled tree-kangaroo] golden-mantled tree-kangaroo ( D. pulcherrimus D. pulcherrimus ) is comparable to that of D. stellarum D. stellarum ; it was first described as a subspecies of D. goodfellowi D. goodfellowi , though recent authorities have elevated it to species status based on its absolute diagnostability. A population of the [tenkile] tenkile (Scott's tree-kangaroo) recently discovered from the [Bewani Mountains] Bewani Mountains may represent an undescribed subspecies. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Tree-kangaroos inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Australia, and some of the islands in the region, in particular, the [Schouten Islands] Schouten Islands and the [Raja Ampat Islands] Raja Ampat Islands . Although most species are found in mountainous areas, several also occur in lowlands, such as the aptly named [lowlands tree-kangaroo] lowlands tree-kangaroo . Most tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction. Because much of their lifestyle involves climbing and jumping between trees, they have evolved an appropriate method of locomotion. Tree-kangaroos thrive in the treetops, as opposed to terrestrial kangaroos which survive on mainland Australia. Two species of tree-kangaroos are found in Australia, Bennett's ( D. bennetianus D. bennetianus ), which is found north of the Daintree River and Lumholtz's ( D. lumholtzi D. lumholtzi ). Tree-kangaroos have adapted better to regions of high altitudes. Tree-kangaroos must find places comfortable and well-adapted for breeding, as they only give birth to one joey per year.  They are known to have one of the most relaxed and leisurely birthing seasons.  They breed cautiously in the treetops during the monsoon season. Their habitats are breeding grounds for danger, as they can easily fall prey to their natural predator, the [amethystine python] amethystine python , which also climbs and lives in the treetops. Tree-kangaroos are known to be able to live in both mountainous regions and lowland locations. 
== Description ==
[Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo] Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo is the smallest of all tree-kangaroos. Its body and head length ranges about 48–65 cm (19–26 in), and its tail, 60–74 cm (24–29 in), with males weighing an average of 7.2 kg (16 lb) and females 5.9 kg (13 lb). The length of [Doria's tree-kangaroo] Doria's tree-kangaroo is 51–78 cm (20–31 in), with a long 44–66 cm (17–26 in) tail, and weighs 6.5–14.5 kg (14–32 lb). [Matschie's tree-kangaroo] Matschie's tree-kangaroo has a body and head length of 81 cm (20 to 32 inches), adult males weigh 9–11 kg (20-25 lb) and adult females weigh 7–9 kg (15-20 lb). The [grizzled tree-kangaroo] grizzled tree-kangaroo grows to a length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in), with males being considerably larger than females, and its weight is 8–15 kg (18-33 lb).
Tree-kangaroos have several adaptations to an arboreal life-style.  Compared to terrestrial kangaroos, tree-kangaroos have longer and broader hind feet with longer, curved nails.  They also have a sponge-like grip on their paws and soles of their feet.  Tree-kangaroos have a much larger and pendulous tail than terrestrial kangaroos, giving them enhanced balance while moving about the trees. Locomotion on the ground is by hopping, as with true kangaroos. Like terrestrial kangaroos, tree-kangaroos do not sweat to cool their bodies, rather, they lick their forearms and allow the moisture to evaporate in an adaptive form of behavioural [thermoregulation] thermoregulation . 
== Behaviour ==
=== Locomotion ===
Tree-kangaroos are slow and clumsy on the ground. They move at approximately human walking pace and hop awkwardly, leaning their body far forward to balance the heavy tail. However, in trees, they are bold and agile. They climb by wrapping their forelimbs around the trunk of a tree and, while allowing the forelimbs to slide, hop up the tree using their powerful hind legs. They are expert leapers; 9 metres (30 ft) downward jumps from one tree to another have been recorded and they have the extraordinary ability to jump to the ground from 18 metres (59 ft) or more without being hurt. 
=== Diet ===
The main diet of the tree-kangaroo is leaves and fruit that it gathers from the trees, but occasionally scavenged from the ground. Tree-kangaroos will also eat grains, flowers, various nuts, sap and tree bark. Some captive tree-kangaroos (perhaps limited to New Guinea species) eat protein foods such as eggs, birds and snakes, making them [omnivores] omnivores . 
=== Reproduction ===
Little is known about the reproduction of tree-kangaroos in the wild. The only published data are from captive individuals. Female tree-kangaroos reach sexual maturity as early as 2.04 years of age and males at 4.6 years.  The female's fertile period is estimated to be approximately two months. They have one of the longest marsupial offspring development/maturation periods; pouch life for the young is 246–275 days long and weaning occurs 87–240 days later. 
== Threats ==
The two most significant threats to tree-kangaroos are habitat loss and hunting. Tree-kangaroo habitats are being destroyed or replaced by logging and timber production, along with coffee, rice and wheat production. This habitat loss can make tree-kangaroos more exposed to predators such as [feral domestic dogs] feral domestic dogs . Being hunted by local community members also contributes markedly to the declines in tree-kangaroo populations. Research conducted on Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo, a species that dwells in the rain forests of northeastern Australia, determined the frequency of causes of death. This showed that of 27 deceased tree-kangaroos, 11 had been killed by vehicles, six by dogs, four by parasites and the remaining six died from other causes. 
== Captivity ==
As of 2021 five of the species are held in captivity. These include populations of Goodfellow's ( D. goodfellowi D. goodfellowi ) and Matschie's ( D. matschiei D. matschiei ), with smaller numbers of Lumholtz's ( D. lumholtzi D. lumholtzi ), Grizzled ( D. inustus D. inustus ), and Doria's ( D. dorianus D. dorianus ) tree kangaroos. These are being kept in a variety of facilities across North America, Oceania, and Europe, with smaller holdings in Asia. The [World Association of Zoos and Aquariums] World Association of Zoos and Aquariums coordinates with regional zoological associations to ensure the coordination of breeding programs to maintain viable breeding populations and genetic diversity outside of the wild populations.
In November 2014 at the [Adelaide Zoo] Adelaide Zoo , an orphaned tree-kangaroo joey was transferred to the pouch of a yellow-footed rock-wallaby when his mother was killed by a falling branch. The joey survived, having been successfully reared by the surrogate mother rock-wallaby. 
On April 29, 2022, the [Bronx Zoo] Bronx Zoo announced the birth of a Matschie's tree kangaroo joey, the first of its species born at the zoo since 2008. The joey was the size of a human thumbnail at birth.

Emperor Tamarin,Emperor tamarin,"
The emperor tamarin emperor tamarin ( Saguinus imperator Saguinus imperator Saguinus imperator ) is a species of [tamarin] tamarin monkey allegedly named for its beard's resemblance to the [German] German  [emperor] emperor  [Wilhelm II] Wilhelm II . It lives in the north [Brazilian] Brazilian  [states] states of [Acre] Acre and [Amazonas] Amazonas and the southwest [Amazon Basin] Amazon Basin , in east [Peru] Peru , north [Bolivia] Bolivia .
The fur of the emperor tamarin is predominantly grey colored, with yellowish speckles on its chest. The hands and feet are black and the tail is brown. Outstanding is its long, white beard, which extends to both sides beyond the shoulders. The animal reaches a length of 23–26 centimetres (9–10 in), plus a 35–41.5 cm (13.8–16.3 in) long tail. It weighs approximately 500 grams (18 oz). 
== Physical description ==
( Saguinus imperator imperator Saguinus imperator imperator ) Black-chinned emperor tamarin 
There are claws on each of the animal's toes and fingers, aside from its big toe, which has a nail. While it has a definitive long mustache, it also has almost inconspicuous white hairs on its chin. Visually, however, the saguinus imperator has a black chin. The hair on its chest and belly are a mixture of red, orange, and white hairs. On its back, the fur is dark brown. The inner side of its arms and legs are an orange-like color.
( Saguinus imperator subgrisecens Saguinus imperator subgrisecens ) Bearded emperor tamarin 
Saguinus imperator subgrisecens Saguinus imperator subgrisecens , unlike S. imperator imperator S. imperator imperator , has a variation in color on its chest, belly, and arms. Also, in addition to its long white mustache, this subspecies has a large white-haired beard, unlike S. imperator imperator S. imperator imperator , which merely has faint black whiskers upon its chin.
Aside from the color changes and visually striking beard, the two tamarins essentially have the same body structure. They are very small, compared to most other primates. Using their claws, they cling to tree branches, maintaining a consistent verticality in the jungle environment. To navigate their lush environment, which typically is in rainforests, they leap and move quickly through trees, rarely touching the [forest floor] forest floor . 
== Habitat ==
Emperor tamarins occur mostly in Amazonian lowland and lower mountain rain forests, as well as remnant, primary, and secondary forests. Amazonian lowland holds an abundance of water during high sea level due to the flooding by nearby water sources.  This contributes to a very humid, tropical climate to occur year-round. The lower montane forests Emperor tamarins are primarily found in are considered tropical and moist with an abundance of vegetation.  During the dry season, flowering peaks and in the wet season, flowering decreases, affecting the diets of the Emperor tamarins. Many Emperor tamarins are found in Amazonian secondary forests, which account for 40% of the forest area. Secondary forests appear to accumulate woody plant species at a relatively rapid rate but the mechanisms involved are complex and no clear pattern emerged. This process helped grow the trees in which Emperor tamarins primarily reside in when found in secondary forests. The average size of the group tamarins live in is two to eight individuals, but it can range from four to eighteen.  They reside in the form of an extended family group, usually with only one breeding female.  The groups they live in usually only consist of Emperor tamarins, but occasionally can also include Saddle-back tamarins considering their food scavenging groups often join together.  This is due to the fact Emperor tamarins tend to stay higher in the canopy than 10 meters, and Saddle-back tamarins usually stay below 10 meters.
Emperor tamarins consume a wide range of specimens in their daily dietary routine.  They eat fruits and flowers, many of which are readily available due to their flourishing vegetational habitats. They also eat the exudes of plants such as gums and saps, easily gouged from the trees they are living in.  Many also choose to consume animal prey, such as insects and frogs, depending upon what type of forest they are located in. Emperor tamarins have been reported to engage in mixed species associations with Weddell's saddle-back tamarins ( S. fuscicollis weddelli S. fuscicollis weddelli ), spending up to 20% of their day foraging in these mixed species troops. Emperor tamarin society is based on a dominance hierarchy led by a dominant female and her mate. It is the dominant emperor tamarins who form these foraging troops, forming these mixed species groups is beneficial to the emperor tamarins and their ability to find quality food resources. Some speculated at one point that females of the species were the primary scavengers of food, specifically fruit and flowers, because of their enhanced abilities over the males in the form of stronger visual cues.  Upon research, it was found that males and females possess the same abilities to locate food patches.  Though it does not discriminate between the two species, females do tend to be the more dominant hunters, which led to the speculation. Weddell's saddle-back tamarins are better and faster at locating food resources. S.fuscicollis S.fuscicollis are a smaller bodied species of tamarins and are able to move fast through the canopy, saddle-back tamarins often arrive to the food resources before the emperor tamarins. The emperor tamarins follow the saddle-back tamarins to food patches using their larger size to intimidate the feeding Weddell's saddle-back tamarins into leaving the feeding tree. This foraging strategy is beneficial to both species, the mixed species troops provide more vigilance for predator protection. Observations of tamarins foraging in mixed species troops using feeding platforms and monitoring fruiting trees show that these troops spend less time foraging in smaller patches of fruiting trees with limited amounts of fruiting resources. 
== Reproduction and infant care ==
The age of first reproduction in emperor tamarins is around 16–20 months old, with a gestation period of up to 6 months. Tamarins are seasonal breeders. Breeding is based around food availability. Most births occur during the wet season when food resources are in abundance.
Tamarin species were once thought to be a monogamous species, but observations of emperor tamarins in the wild show that they have a [polyandrous] polyandrous mating system, with one dominant female mating with multiple males. This mating system works to ensure paternal investment in offspring. If a female mates with multiple males and give birth to a litter, males are more likely to invest because of the possibility that one of the infants will carry their genes onto the next generation. Due to high rates of twinning or multiple births in Emperor tamarins, parental care and paternal investment is important to infant survival. Previously the only knowledge of tamarin infant care came from captive studies on Cotton-top tamarins ( S. oedipus S. oedipus ), which demonstrated that infant survival is dependent on helpers. Helpers are either older female offspring of the dominant female that have remained in their natal group or the males that most frequently interact with the dominant female. Infant carrying has a high energetic cost due to the relatively large fetal weight of infants to the weight of adults. Helpers provide the extra support to remove some of the cost of caring for multiple infants. Male emperor tamarins have been observed to spend the most time with infants, often carrying both infants while the dominant female forages. Male emperor tamarins are reported to be more observant of the infants and more protective. For example, they are known to react faster to infant distress calls than females.
[Infant mortality] Infant mortality in the wild is at its highest during weeks 5–15 of their lives, when they begin to move around and explore on their own, this is because one of the greatest threats to infant survival is falling from the canopy. 
== Distribution ==
The emperor tamarin can be found in Brazil; places in Peru and Bolivia that are parts of the southwest Amazon Basin; east of the upper [Purus river] Purus river ; between the Purus river and Rio Acre; east of the upper Juruá river to the Tarauacá river and Juruparí river; west to the Urubamba river and Inuya river; and south of Tahuamanú river. 
According to Buchanan's research, the subspecies of S. imperator S. imperator , S. i. imperator S. i. imperator , are rarely found in Los Campos and Buena Vista, which are located near the left bank of the [Rio Acre] Rio Acre ; and in the banks of the [Purus River] Purus River and [Eiru River] Eiru River . 
Lastly, according to Buchanan and Bairrao, the subspecies, S. i. subgrisescens S. i. subgrisescens , can be found on the upper banks of the [Juruá River] Juruá River ; south of the Tahuamanú river and along the banks of the Muyumanu river. 
== Behavior ==
Emperor tamarins behave actively, rapidly, gracefully, gregariously, and playfully in the wild. In captivity the tamarins are very social and interactive with humans. A study by Knox, Kerry L. and Donald Stone Sade of the social behavior of emperor tamarins in captivity found that tamarin colonies behave agonistically according to seniority. There is an agonistic network where each component along a continuum from strongly dominant individuals interaction with strongly subordinate individuals. In the interactions the tamarins usually communicate threat and submission. The aggression is more frequently among individuals of the same sex, most frequently between juvenile males and juvenile males, between juvenile females and juvenile females and also between sexed twins. There are matrices of within family groups of emperor tamarins where a large proportion of the total number of agonistic interaction within a group occurs between pairs of siblings from different litters. The dynamics of agonistic relations within a group is not just only for the status of the breeding pair but may also influence the allocation of reproductive effort. Family members other than the breeding female may suppress reproduction in adult daughters too. There are certain behaviors that were identified as dominant and some responses as subordinate. The dominant most frequent behaviors happened when the tamarin's mouth is completely opened and show the teeth, when they mount another tamarin or when a tamarin approaches from the rear and encircles another tamarin's waist with both arms. A dominant tamarin will usually display many components at the same time. The Subordinate most frequent behaviors are always responses to dominant components and they happened when the subordinate tamarin brings his or her anogenital region into the view of the other tamarin as usually part of a sequence of their body being displayed, when they made a wide-mouth grimace or after they have been mounted they look backward at the dominant tamarin but does not make eye contact. There is always a dominant component toward another tamarin, which immediately responds, with a subordinate component. Long calls and tongue flicking was sometimes part of the agonistic behavior repertoire. 
Communication is a key behavior, a facilitation of cohesion and coordination among group-living tamarins. There was also an agonistic interaction with saddle back tamarins and emperors, where the emperor tamarins were the dominant species. The long call is the most likely call in the tamarin vocal repertoire to serve as a coordinating signal. Long call vocalization has been hypothesized to serve as communicative signals both within and between Tamarin species. Long calls are usually quite loud and can be hear by humans over 150 m away. Emperor tamarins often produce long call upon leaving their sleeping sites at the morning and then periodically throughout the day, especially when travelling or participating in territorial encounters with neighbor tamarin groups. Long calls promote contact between neighbor tamarin groups. Long calls also function as interspecific signals consisting of counter-calling between heterospecific groups that travel together or approach another after period separations throughout the day. Emperor tamarin long calls generally cover a broader frequency range and the notes are shorter and repeated more quickly than those produced by saddle back tamarins. The acoustical differences between saddle back and emperor tamarin calls allow humans to differentiate between them easily. Tamarins are able to identify the sex of unfamiliar callers too. Emperor tamarins respond in high rates of to the calls from conspecific and heterospecific species calls but not that much to polyspecific species calls. Emperor tamarins displayed higher frequencies of approach towards the speaking following playback of tamarin long calls. Communication between tamarin species via long calls included high vocalization rates before reinitiating contact in the morning and during travel when two groups may become separated. Individuals also call at high rates in the morning and during travel when they are with another tamarin and when they are alone. They call the groups simultaneously. The calls are an exchange has the potential to act as a proximate mechanism facilitating coordination, both within conspecific tamarin and heterospecific tamarin. Sometimes tamarins consider the broadcast of calls as a challenge to their territory against intruders. Counter-calling between species represents interspecific communication in polyspecific tamarin associations. Emperor tamarins distinguish between calls on the basis of social relationships. 
The emperor tamarin forms mixed-species troops with [Weddell's saddle-back tamarin] Weddell's saddle-back tamarin and also associates with [Goeldi's marmoset] Goeldi's marmoset . 
== Conservation ==
Emperor tamarins are listed by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species of [Least Concern] Least Concern , and there are no conservation efforts aimed directly towards this species of primates. Emperor tamarins populations have been in decline due to threats of [deforestation] deforestation and human encroachment. [Forest fragmentation] Forest fragmentation has become a huge problem for arboreal primate species in the neotropics: fragmentation causes the tamarins range to be restricted, causing populations to be isolated. Emperor tamarins are located in [protected areas] protected areas in [Peru] Peru at [Manú National Park] Manú National Park and [Bolivia] Bolivia at [Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve] Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve . There are no protected areas that overlap with the Brazilian populations of emperor tamarins. 
Manú National Park in Peru provides protection of the natural habitat of the emperor tamarins. This national park is considered to be one of the world's most important protected areas because of it being located within one of the largest biodiversity hotspots and its high species richness. The National Park is home to small populations of indigenous people, these indigenous people are permitted to hunt in the park. Research shows that indigenous subsistence hunting has effects on the larger bodied primates in the park but shows minimal effects on the emperor tamarin population size. There is evidence that hunting has extended the range of emperor tamarins which originally were restricted to the north bank of the [Manú River] Manú River are also now found on the south bank. Manú National Park had a successful community based ecotourism industry, and in recent years ecotourism has increased as Park administration and NGOs have taken interest in improving the livelihoods of the indigenous populations. Though there is cause for concern that improving the livelihoods and infrastructure of the national park may lead to negative effects on the wildlife populations including the emperor tamarins. 
== Human interactions ==
Many zoos observe interesting behaviors of Emperor tamarins held in captivity. According to staff at the [Jackson Zoo] Jackson Zoo in [Jackson, Mississippi] Jackson, Mississippi , their Emperor tamarins display a need for tenderness. Staff at [San Francisco Zoo] San Francisco Zoo have reported that the species takes part in [mutual grooming] mutual grooming .

The mandrill mandrill ( Mandrillus sphinx Mandrillus sphinx Mandrillus sphinx ) is a large [Old World monkey] Old World monkey native to west central Africa. It is one of the most colorful mammals in the world, with red and blue skin on its face and posterior. The species is [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic , as males have a larger body, longer canine teeth and brighter coloring. It is the largest monkey in the world. Its closest living relative is the [drill] drill , with which it shares the [genus] genus  Mandrillus [Mandrillus] Mandrillus . Both species were traditionally thought to be [baboons] baboons , but further evidence has shown that they are more closely related to [white-eyelid mangabeys] white-eyelid mangabeys .
Mandrills mainly live in [tropical rainforests] tropical rainforests but will also travel across [savannas] savannas . They are [active during the day] active during the day and spend most of their time on the ground. Their preferred foods are fruit and seeds, but mandrills will consume leaves, [piths] piths , mushrooms, and animals from insects to juvenile [bay duiker] bay duiker . Mandrills live in large, stable groups known as ""hordes"" which can number in the hundreds. Females form the core of these groups, while adult males are solitary and only reunite with the larger groups during the breeding season. Dominant males have the most vibrant colors and fattest flanks and rumps, and have the most success siring young.
The mandrill is classified as [vulnerable] vulnerable on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List . Its biggest threats are [habitat destruction] habitat destruction and hunting for [bushmeat] bushmeat . [Gabon] Gabon is considered the stronghold for the species. Its habitat has declined in [Cameroon] Cameroon and [Equatorial Guinea] Equatorial Guinea , while its range in the [Republic of the Congo] Republic of the Congo is limited.
== Etymology ==
The word mandrill mandrill is derived from the English words man man and drill drill —the latter meaning ' ' baboon [baboon] baboon ' ' or ' ' ape [ape] ape ' ' and being West African in origin—and dated to 1744. The name appears to have originally referred to [chimpanzees] chimpanzees . The first scholar to record the name for the colorful monkey was [Georges-Louis Buffon] Georges-Louis Buffon in 1766. It was called the ""tufted ape"", ""great baboon"" and ""ribbernosed baboon"" by [Thomas Pennant] Thomas Pennant in A Synopsis of Quadrupeds A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (1771) and A History of Quadrupeds A History of Quadrupeds (1781). 
== Taxonomy ==
The mandrill was first scientifically depicted in Historia animalium [Historia animalium] Historia animalium (1551–1558) by [Conrad Gessner] Conrad Gessner , who considered it a kind of [hyena] hyena . The species was formally classified by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus as Simia sphinx Simia sphinx in 1758. Its current generic name Mandrillus [Mandrillus] Mandrillus was coined by [Ferdinand Ritgen] Ferdinand Ritgen in 1824. 
Historically, some scientists placed the mandrill and the closely related [drill] drill ( M. leucophaeus M. leucophaeus ) in the baboon genus Papio [Papio] Papio . [Morphological] Morphological and [genetic studies] genetic studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries found a closer relationship to [white-eyelid mangabeys] white-eyelid mangabeys of the genus Cercocebus Cercocebus . Some have even proposed that the mandrill and drill belong to Cercocebus Cercocebus . Two genetic studies in 2011 clarified Mandrillus Mandrillus and Cercocebus Cercocebus as separate [sister lineages] sister lineages . The two genera [split] split around 4.5 million years ago (mya) while the mandrill and drill split approximately 3.17 mya. Fossils of Mandrillus Mandrillus have not been found.

Some authorities have divided mandrill populations into [subspecies] subspecies : the northern mandrill ( M. s. sphinx M. s. sphinx ) and the southern mandrill ( M. s. madarogaster M. s. madarogaster ). A proposed third subspecies, M. s. insularis M. s. insularis , was based on the mistaken belief that mandrills are present on [Bioko Island] Bioko Island . The consensus is that mandrills belong to one subspecies ( M. s. sphinx M. s. sphinx ). 
[Cytochrome-b] Cytochrome-b sequences suggest that mandrill populations north and south of the [Ogooué River] Ogooué River split 800,000 years ago and belong to distinct [haplogroups] haplogroups . This divergence appears to have also led to the splitting of the mandrill strain of the [simian immunodeficiency virus] simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The draft (incomplete) [genome] genome of the mandrill was published in 2020, with a reported [genome size] genome size of 2.90 [giga–base-pairs] giga–base-pairs and high levels of [heterozygosity] heterozygosity . 
== Characteristics ==
The mandrill has a stocky body with a large head and muzzle, as well as a short and stumpy tail. The limbs are evenly sized and the fingers and toes are more elongated than those in baboons, with a more opposable big toe on the feet. The mandrill is the most [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic primate, and it is the largest [monkey] monkey . Females are less stocky and have shorter, flatter snouts. Males have a 70–95 cm (28–37 in) head-body length and weigh 19–30 kg (42–66 lb) while females have a 55–70 cm (22–28 in) head-body length and weigh 10–15 kg (22–33 lb). Most of the teeth are larger in males, and the canine teeth reach up to 4.5 cm (1.8 in) and 1 cm (0.39 in) long for males and females respectively. Both sexes have 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in) long tails. 
The [coat] coat of the mandrill is primarily grizzled or [banded] banded olive-brown with a yellow-orange beard and sparse, light hairs on its underside. The lips are surrounded by stiff white [whiskers] whiskers , and white bare skin exists behind the ears. Male mandrills have a ""crest"" of long hairs on the head and neck, while both sexes have chest glands which are covered by long hairs. The face, rump and genitals have less hair. The mandrill has a red line running down the middle of their face which connects to their red nose. On either side of the line, the skin is blue and grooved. In males, the blue skin is supported by ridged bone swellings. Females have more subdued facial coloring, but this can vary between individuals with some having stronger red and blue hues and others being darker or almost black. In males, the rump and areas around the genitals are multi-colored, consisting of red, pink, blue and purple skin, with a red penis shaft and violet scrotum. The genital and anal areas of the female are red. 
The mandrill is among the most colorful mammals. [Charles Darwin] Charles Darwin wrote in The Descent of Man [The Descent of Man] The Descent of Man : ""no other member of the whole class of mammals is coloured in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrill"". The red coloration is created by blood vessels near the surface of the skin, while the blue is a form of [structural coloration] structural coloration caused by parallel arrangements of [collagen] collagen fibers. The blue ridges on males contrast with both the red facial hues and the green foliage of their environment, helping them stand out to other individuals. The darker and more subdued coloring of female faces is caused by [melanin] melanin . 
== Ecology ==
The mandrill lives in west-central Africa, including southern [Cameroon] Cameroon , mainland [Equatorial Guinea] Equatorial Guinea ( [Río Muni] Río Muni ), [Gabon] Gabon and parts of the [Republic of the Congo] Republic of the Congo . Its range is bounded by the [Sanaga River] Sanaga River to the north and the Ogooué and [Ivindo Rivers] Ivindo Rivers to the east. It does not appear to [share habitat] share habitat with the drill, as the two species are separated by the Sanaga River. Mandrills live in [tropical rainforests] tropical rainforests , generally preferring [primary forests] primary forests over [secondary forests] secondary forests . They also live in patchy [gallery forests] gallery forests surrounded by [savanna] savanna and travel across grass areas within their forest habitats. They have also been recorded in mountainous areas, near rivers and in [cultivated fields] cultivated fields . 
Mandrills prefer thick bush dominated by [perennial plants] perennial plants like [gingers] gingers and plants of the genera Brillantaisia [Brillantaisia] Brillantaisia and Phaulopsis [Phaulopsis] Phaulopsis . They mainly dwell on the ground, but feed as high as the [canopy] canopy . Both mandrills and drills are more [arboreal] arboreal than baboons. Mandrills may aggregate or compete with other primates such as [talapoins] talapoins , [guenons] guenons , mangabeys, [black-and-white colobuses] black-and-white colobuses , [chimpanzees] chimpanzees , and [gorillas] gorillas . 
=== Feeding ===
The mandrill is an [omnivore] omnivore . The core of its diet consists of plants, of which it eats over a hundred species. One study found the mandrill's diet was composed of fruit (50.7%), seeds (26.0%), leaves (8.2%), [pith] pith (6.8%), flowers (2.7%), and animal matter (4.1%), with other foods making up the remaining 1.4%. During the wet season, mandrills forage in continuous forest, when fruit is most available, while during the dry season they feed in gallery forests and at the borders of savannas and forests. 
The mandrill's preferred fruits include those of the [cashew] cashew species Pseudospondias microcarpa [Pseudospondias microcarpa] Pseudospondias microcarpa , the [coffee] coffee species Nauclea diderrichii [Nauclea diderrichii] Nauclea diderrichii and the [wort] wort species Psorospermum febrifugum [Psorospermum febrifugum] Psorospermum febrifugum . Mandrills consume more seeds than many other primate species. Adult male mandrills are one of the few primates capable of biting through the hard shell of Detarium microcarpum [Detarium microcarpum] Detarium microcarpum seeds. For vegetation, they mostly eat the young leaves, shoots and piths of [monocot] monocot plants. In particular, mandrills consume leaves from the [arrowroots] arrowroots  Haumania liebrechtsiana [Haumania liebrechtsiana] Haumania liebrechtsiana and Trachyphrynium braunianum [Trachyphrynium braunianum] Trachyphrynium braunianum , as well as the piths of ginger plants like Renealmia macrocolia [Renealmia macrocolia] Renealmia macrocolia and species in the genus Aframomum [Aframomum] Aframomum . They are also known to consume mushrooms. 
The rest of a mandrill's diet is largely made up of invertebrates, particularly [ants] ants , [termites] termites , [crickets] crickets , [spiders] spiders , [snails] snails , and [scorpions] scorpions . They also eat birds and their eggs, frogs and rodents. Mandrills have been recorded preying on larger vertebrates such as juvenile [bay duikers] bay duikers . Such prey is killed with a bite to the head followed by pulling off the hind limbs and tearing open the belly. Individuals may cooperate during hunting and share kills. 
=== Predators, parasites and pathogens ===
[Leopards] Leopards may prey on mandrills, as traces of mandrill have been found in their feces. Other potential predators include [African rock pythons] African rock pythons , [crowned eagles] crowned eagles and chimpanzees. Leopards are a threat to all individuals, while eagles are only threats to the young. In a study where a mandrill group was exposed to models of leopards and crown eagles, the leopard models tended to cause the mandrills to flee up trees while the eagles were more likely to drive them to take cover. The dominant male did not flee from either model types; in the case of the leopards, he paced around while looking in their direction. [Alarm calls] Alarm calls were more commonly heard in response to leopards than eagles. 
Mandrills can become infected with gastrointestinal parasites, such as [nematodes] nematodes and [protozoa] protozoa . [Tumbu fly] Tumbu fly larvae may live under the skin and individuals that walk though grassland can get infested with [ticks] ticks . Blood parasites include the [malaria] malaria -causing Plasmodium [Plasmodium] Plasmodium and the nematode Loa loa [Loa loa] Loa loa , which is transmitted by bites from [deer flies] deer flies . Wild mandrills have tested positive for SIV, [enteroviruses] enteroviruses of the species [EV-J] EV-J and [astroviruses] astroviruses , including a human variant. 
== Behavior and life history ==
Mandrills are mostly [diurnal] diurnal and are awake around 10 hours per day from morning to dusk. They often pick a new tree to sleep in every night. Mandrills have been observed [using tools] using tools ; in captivity, they use sticks to clean themselves. In the wild, mandrills appear to live 12–14 years, but captive individuals can live 30–40 years. 
=== Social structure ===
Mandrills live in large ""supergroups"" or ""hordes"" that can contain hundreds of individuals. These large groups are fairly stable and do not appear to be gatherings of smaller ones. At [Lopé National Park] Lopé National Park , Gabon, mandrill hordes were found to have an average of 620 individuals, and some groups were as large as 845, making them possibly the largest cohesive groups of wild primates. Another study in Lopé found that a horde of 625 mandrills consisted of 21 dominant males, 71 less dominant and subadult males, 247 adult and adolescent females, 200 juveniles, and 86 dependent infants. A mandrill horde of around 700 individuals in northern Lopé had a total [home range] home range of 182 km (70 sq mi), 89 km (34 sq mi) of which was suitable habitat. The supergroup would occasionally diverge into two to four subgroups before reuniting. Another 15-month long study of a 120-member group found a home range of 8.6 km (3.3 sq mi) with an average traveling distance of 2.42 km (1.50 mi) per day. 
Hordes consist of [matrilineal] matrilineal family groups, and females are important for maintaining social cohesion. Strong connections with their relatives may lead to support during conflicts, higher survival rate of offspring and a longer lifespan for females. Dominant females are at the center of the group network and their removal leads to fewer social connections in the group. The social rank of a mother mandrill can contribute to the social rank of both her female and male offspring. Mature males are not permanent members of hordes but join as females become sexually receptive and leave as their sexual cycle ends. As a result, the coloration of the male mandrill may be intended to attract attention in a social structure with no long-term relationships between mates. Higher ranking males are found in the center of a social group while lower ranking males are more likely to occupy the periphery. Females have some control over the males and coalitions can expel an unwanted male from a group. Outside the breeding season, males are believed to lead a solitary life and all-male [bachelor groups] bachelor groups are not known to exist. 
Both male and female mandrills rub and mark trees and branches with secretions from their chest glands, though males (and especially dominant males) mark more than females. The chemicals in the secretions signal the individual's sex, age and rank. Scent-marking may also serve a [territorial] territorial function, captive alpha males will mark enclosure boundaries. Mandrills will [groom] groom one another, even when there is no benefit to be gained from doing so. During grooming, subordinates prefer to pick at other mandrills from behind, in order to minimize eye contact and give them more time to flee if the more dominant individual attacks. The recipients of grooming will try to maneuver the groomer to pick at more ""risky"" areas. 
=== Reproduction and development ===
Dominant or [alpha male] alpha male mandrills have the most mating success. Upon gaining alpha status, males develop larger testicles, redder faces and posteriors, more secretion from the chest glands and fatter sides and rumps. When a male loses dominance, these physiological changes are at least partially reversed. The blue facial skin is more consistent in brightness. Higher ranking males tend to have more contrast between red and blue facial coloring. Due to their distribution of fat, dominant males are also known as ""fatted"" males while subordinate males are known as ""non-fatted"" males. Canine length also correlates with dominance, and males are less likely to sire offspring when their canines are under 30 mm (1.2 in). In some individuals, the development of [secondary sexual characteristics] secondary sexual characteristics is [suppressed] suppressed in response to competition from other males. Male mandrills tend to establish dominance with vocalizations and facial expressions, rather than fighting. 
Mating occurs mostly during the dry season, with female [ovulation] ovulation peaking between June and September. Receptive females have [sexual swellings] sexual swellings on their posteriors, and the red facial coloration can communicate age and fertility. Males also appear to detect a female's reproductive state using the [vomeronasal organ] vomeronasal organ (known as the [flehmen response] flehmen response ). Dominant males try to monopolize access to females by mate guarding, which involves the male tending to and [copulating] copulating with a female for days. Dominant males tend to sire most of the offspring, but they are less able to monopolize access to the females when many females reach [estrus] estrus at the same time. A subordinate male is also more likely to have reproductive success if he is closely related to an alpha male. An ovulating female tends to allow the brightest colored males to come near her and touch her [perineum] perineum , and is more likely to groom and solicit them. The female signals her willingness to mate by positioning her posterior towards the male. Intercourse lasts no more than 60 seconds, with the male mounting the female and making pelvic thrusts. 
Mandrill gestation lasts an average of 175 days with most births taking place between January and March, during the wet season. Gaps in between births range from 184 to 1,159 days with an average of 405 days. and tend to be shorter in higher ranking females. Infants are born at an average weight of 640 g (23 oz), and mostly bare-skinned with some white hair and a tuft of dark hair on the head and along the spine. Over the next two or three months, they develop their adult hair color on the body, limbs and head while the flesh-colored face and snout darken. Dependent infants are carried on their mothers' bellies. Young are typically weaned at around 230 days old. Males become more sexually dimorphic between four and eight years old, at which point females are already beginning to give birth. Males start leaving their horde after they reach six years old. Females reach their adult size around seven years while males do so at ten years. 
=== Communication ===
Mandrills communicate with various facial expressions and postures. Threat displays involve open mouth staring, usually in combination with head bobbing, ground slapping and [raised hair] raised hair . These gestures are usually performed by dominant individuals towards subordinates, who respond with bared teeth grimaces, signaling fear and aggression. Both young and low-ranking females show submission and anxiety with a pouting ""duck face"". Playful intentions are communicated with a relaxed open-mouth face. Males approaching females display a ""grin"" or silent bared-teeth face and make lip-smacks. This display may also occur with teeth-chattering. Mandrills can develop and pass on new gestures; captive individuals at the [Colchester Zoo] Colchester Zoo , England [facepalm] facepalm to discourage being disturbed, particularly while resting. 
Mandrills also produce several vocalizations, for both long and short distances. During group movements, adult males produce two-phase grunts and one-syllable roars, both of which are equivalent to the ""wahoo"" bark of baboons. Other group members produce ""crowings"", which last almost two seconds and start as a vibration and transition into a longer harmonic sound. Short distance vocals include the ""yak"", a sharp, repeating, pulse-like call produced by all individuals except for adult males and made in tense situations. Mandrills may also grunt during aggressive encounters. Growls are used to express mild alarm while intense alarms come in the form of a short, two-syllable sharp call known as the ""k-alarm"". A sharp, loud ""K-sound"" is produced for unknown reasons. Screaming is a signal of fear and made by individuals fleeing, while the [girney] girney , a type of moan or purr, is made as a form of appeasement or frustration among females and young. Individual voices are more similar among related animals, but unrelated mandrills can have similar voices if they regularly interact. 
== Threats and conservation ==
As of 2019, the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List lists the mandrill as [vulnerable] vulnerable . Its total population is unknown but is suspected to have decreased by more than 30 percent over the last 24 years. Its main threats are [habitat destruction] habitat destruction and hunting for [bushmeat] bushmeat . The mandrill appears to have suffered massive habitat loss in Equatorial Guinea and southern Cameroon, while its range in the Republic of the Congo is limited and its status is unknown. In addition, while mandrills live in groups numbering in the hundreds, hunting in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea appears to have led to smaller group sizes. Gabon is seen as the most important remaining refuge for the species, and the country's low population density and vast rainforests make it a good candidate for mandrill conservation. Surveys have shown high population numbers for other primate species like chimpanzees and gorillas. A semi-wild population exists at the [International Centre of Medical Research of Franceville] International Centre of Medical Research of Franceville . 
The mandrill is listed under Appendix I by [CITES] CITES , banning commercial trade in wild-caught specimens, and under Class B by the [African Convention] African Convention , which provides them protection but allows special authorization for their killing, capturing or collecting. There is at least one [protected area] protected area for mandrills within each of the countries they inhabit. In Gabon, most of the rainforests have been leased to timber companies but around 10 percent is part of a national parks system, 13 of which were established in 2002.

Pyrenean Ibex,Pyrenean ibex,"
The Pyrenean ibex Pyrenean ibex ( Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica ), [Aragonese] Aragonese and [Spanish] Spanish common name bucardo bucardo bucardo , [Basque] Basque common name bukardo bukardo bukardo , [Catalan] Catalan common name herc herc herc and [French] French common name bouquetin bouquetin bouquetin , was one of the four [subspecies] subspecies of the [Iberian ibex] Iberian ibex or Iberian wild goat, a species endemic to the [Pyrenees] Pyrenees . Pyrenean ibex were most common in the [Cantabrian Mountains] Cantabrian Mountains , [Southern France] Southern France , and the northern Pyrenees. This species was common during the [Holocene] Holocene and [Upper Pleistocene] Upper Pleistocene , during which their morphology, primarily some skulls, of the Pyrenean ibex was found to be larger than other Capra Capra subspecies in southwestern Europe from the same time.
In January 2000, the last Pyrenean ibex died, making the species [extinct] extinct . Other subspecies have survived: the [western Spanish] western Spanish or Gredos ibex and the [southeastern Spanish] southeastern Spanish or beceite ibex, while the [Portuguese ibex] Portuguese ibex had already become extinct. Since the last of the Pyrenean ibex became extinct before scientists could adequately analyze them, the taxonomy of this particular subspecies is controversial.
Following several failed attempts to revive the subspecies through cloning, a living specimen was born in July 2003. The cloned Pyrenean ibex was born in [Spain] Spain through genetic cloning techniques, with the research article published in 2009. However, she died several minutes after birth due to a lung defect. The Pyrenean ibex remains the only animal to have ever been [brought back from extinction] brought back from extinction —and also the only one to go extinct twice.
== History ==
Multiple theories are given regarding the evolution and historical migration of C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica into the [Iberian Peninsula] Iberian Peninsula , and the relationship between the different subspecies.
One possibility is that C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica evolved from an ancestor related to C. caucasica [C. caucasica] C. caucasica from the [Middle East] Middle East , at the beginning of the last [glacial period] glacial period (120–80 ky).  C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica probably moved from the northern [Alps] Alps through southern France into the Pyrenees area at the beginning of [Magdalenian] Magdalenian period about 18 kya. If this is the case, then C. caucasica praepyrenaica C. caucasica praepyrenaica may have been more different from the other three ibex species that lived in the Iberian Peninsula than scientists currently know. For example, this would mean that the C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica (possible migration 18ky) and C. ibex C. ibex (300 ky earlier migration) would have evolved from different ancestors and been [morphologically] morphologically more different from their separate genes. It is known that all four subspecies lived together in the Upper Pleistocene time, but scientists are unsure of how much genetic exchange could have occurred. The problem with this theory is that genetics suggest that C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica and C. ibex C. ibex may have shared a more common origin, possibly C. camburgensis [C. camburgensis] C. camburgensis . 
Many versions of when C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica or C. ibex C. ibex first migrated to and evolved in the Iberian Peninsula are related. C. pyrenaica C. pyrenaica possibly was already living in the Iberian Peninsula when the ibex began to migrate through the Alps. Genetic evidence also supports the theory that multiple Capra Capra subspecies migrated to the Iberian region around the same time. [Hybridization] Hybridization may have been possible, but the results are not conclusive. 
== Behaviour and physical characteristics ==
The Pyrenean ibex had short hair which varied according to seasons. During the summer, its hair was short, and in winter, the hair grew longer and thicker. The hair on the ibex's neck remained long through all seasons. Male and female ibex could be distinguished due to color, fur, and horn differences. The male was a faded grayish brown during the summer, and they were decorated with black in several places on the body such as the mane, forelegs, and forehead. In the winter, the ibex was less colorful. The male transformed from a greyish brown to a dull grey and where the spots were once black, he became dull and faded. The female ibex, though, could be mistaken for a deer since her coat was brown throughout the summer. Unlike the male ibex, a female lacked black coloring. Young ibex were colored like the female for the first year of life. 
The male had large, thick horns, curving outwards and backwards, then outwards and downwards, then inwards and upwards. The surface of the horn was ridged, and the ridges developing progressively with age. The ridges were said to each represent a year, so the total would correspond to the ibex's age. The female had short, cylindrical horns. Ibex fed on vegetation such as grasses and herbs. 
Pyrenean ibex migrated according to seasons. In spring, the ibex would migrate to more elevated parts of mountains where females and males would mate. In spring, females would normally separate from the males, so they could give birth in more isolated areas. Kids were typically born during May, usually singularly. During the winter, the ibex would migrate to valleys that are not covered in snow. These valleys allowed them to eat regardless of the change in season. 
== Habitat ==
The species was often seen in parts of France, Portugal, Spain and Andorra, but not as much in northern areas of the [Iberian Peninsula] Iberian Peninsula . In areas like Andorra and France in the mainland, the Pyrenean ibex became extinct first in the northern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. The Pyrenean ibex was estimated to have a peak population of 50,000 individuals with more than 50 other subgroups that ranged from the Sierra Nevada to Sierra Morena and Muela de Cortes. Many of these subgroups lived in mountainous terrain extending into Spain and Portugal. The last remaining Pyrenean ibex were seen in areas of the Middle and Eastern Pyrenees, below 1,200 metres (3,940 ft) altitude. However, in areas of southern France and surrounding areas, ibex were found from 350–925 metres (1,150–3,030 ft) to 1,190–2,240 metres (3,900–7,350 ft). 
The Pyrenean ibex was abundant until the 14th century and numbers did not dwindle in the region until the mid-19th century. Pyrenean ibex tended to live in rocky habitats with cliffs and trees interspersed with scrub or pine trees. However, small patches of rocks in farmland or various areas along the Iberian coast also formed suitable habitat. The ibex was able to thrive well in its environment as long as the appropriate habitat was available, and was able to disperse rapidly and colonize quickly. Pyrenean ibex formed a useful resource for humans, which may have been a cause of their eventual extinction. Researchers say that the eventual downfall of the Pyrenean ibex may have been caused by continuous hunting and even perhaps that the animal could not compete with the other livestock in the area. However, definite reasons for the extinction of this animal are still unknown. 
The subspecies once ranged across the [Pyrenees] Pyrenees in France and Spain and the surrounding area, including the [Basque Country] Basque Country , [Navarre] Navarre , north [Aragon] Aragon , and north [Catalonia] Catalonia . A few hundred years ago, they were numerous, but by 1900, their numbers had fallen to fewer than 100. From 1910 onwards, their numbers never rose above 40, and the subspecies was found only in a small part of [Ordesa National Park] Ordesa National Park , in [Huesca] Huesca .
== Extinction ==
The Pyrenean ibex was one of four subspecies of the Iberian ibex. The first to become extinct was the Portuguese ibex ( Capra pyrenaica lusitanica Capra pyrenaica lusitanica ) in 1892. The Pyrenean ibex was the second, with the last individual, a female called Celia, found dead in 2000.
In the Middle Ages, Pyrenean ibex were very abundant in the Pyrenees region, but decreased rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries due to hunting pressure. In the second half of the 20th century, only a small population survived in the [Ordesa National Park] Ordesa National Park situated in the Spanish Central Pyrenees. 
Competition with domestic and wild ungulates also contributed to the extinction of the Pyrenean ibex. Much of its range was shared with sheep, domestic goats, cattle, and horses, especially in summer when it was in the high mountain pastures. This led to interspecific competition and [overgrazing] overgrazing , which particularly affected the ibex in dry years. In addition, the introduction of non-native wild ungulate species in areas occupied by the ibex (e.g. [fallow deer] fallow deer and [mouflon] mouflon in the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park) increased the grazing pressure, as well as the risk of transmission of both native and exotic diseases. 
The [last] last natural Pyrenean ibex, a female named Celia, was found dead on January 6, 2000; she had been killed by a fallen tree. The reason for the subspecies' decline and [extinction] extinction is not fully understood. Some hypotheses include the inability to compete with other species for food, infections and diseases, and [poaching] poaching .
The Pyrenean ibex became the first [taxon] taxon ever to become "" [unextinct] unextinct "" on July 30, 2003, when a cloned female ibex was born alive and survived for several minutes, before dying from lung defects.

Celia, the last ibex, was captured in [Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park] Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in [Huesca] Huesca , Spain; skin biopsies were taken and cryopreserved in nitrogen. She died a year after tissue was harvested from her ear. American biotechnology company [Advanced Cell Technology, Inc.] Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. announced in 2000 that the Spanish government would let them try to clone her from those samples. ACT intended to work alongside other scientists to clone Celia by [nuclear transfer] nuclear transfer .
It was expected to be easier than the cloning experiment of endangered [gaur] gaur ( Bos gaurus Bos gaurus ), as the reproductive biology of goats is better known and the normal gestation period is only five months. In addition, only certain extinct animals are candidates for cloning because of the need for a suitable proxy surrogate to carry the clone to term. ACT agreed with the government of Aragon that the future cloned Pyrenean ibex would be returned to their original habitat.
Celia provided suitable tissue samples for cloning. However, attempts to clone her highlighted a major problem: even if it were possible to produce another healthy Pyrenean ibex, no males were available for the female clone to breed with. To produce a viable population of a previously extinct animal, genetic samples from many individuals would be needed to create genetic diversity in the cloned population. This is a major obstacle to re-establishing an extinct species population through cloning. One solution could be to cross Celia's clones with males of another subspecies, although the offspring would not be pure Pyrenean ibex. A more ambitious plan would be to remove one X chromosome and add a Y chromosome from another still-existing subspecies, creating a male Pyrenean ibex, but such technology does not yet exist, and it is not known whether this will be feasible at all without irreparable damage to the cell.
Three teams of scientists, two Spanish and one French, are involved in the cloning project. One of the Spanish teams was led by Dr. Jose Folch of Zaragoza, from the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon. The other teams had researchers from the National Research Institute of Agriculture and Food in Madrid. 
The project is coordinated by the Food and Agricultural Investigation Service of the Government of Aragon (Spanish: Servicio de Investigación Agroalimentaria del Gobierno de Aragón Servicio de Investigación Agroalimentaria del Gobierno de Aragón ) and by the National Institute of Investigation and Food and Agrarian Technology (Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria) (Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria) . The National Institute of Agrarian Investigation ( [INRA] INRA ) of France is also involved in the project.
Researchers took adult somatic cells from the tissue and fused them with oocytes from goats that had their nuclei removed. The purpose of removing the nuclei from the goats' oocytes was to extract all the DNA of the goat, so there would be no genetic contribution to the clone from the egg donor. The resultant embryos were transferred into a domestic goat ( Capra hircus Capra hircus ), to act as a surrogate mother. The first cloning attempts failed. Of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 ibex and ibex-goat hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they, too, died.
On July 30, 2003, one clone was born alive, but died several minutes later due to physical defects in the lungs. There was [atelectasis] atelectasis and an [extra lobe in the left lung] extra lobe in the left lung . Despite this setback, cloned cells of Celia taken by a research team are still being studied in attempt to create hybrids. Cells for this organism are alive and frozen, giving this an advantage over bringing back extinct species like mammoths who have very ancient DNA. Still, reproductive biotechnology has a long way to go before communities can be replicated or brought back.
This was the first attempt to [revive an extinct subspecies] revive an extinct subspecies , although the process technically began before the extinction of the subspecies.

Binturong,Binturong,"
The binturong binturong ( Arctictis binturong Arctictis binturong Arctictis binturong ) ( [/bɪnˈtjʊərɒŋ,ˈbɪntjʊrɒŋ/] / b b ɪ ɪ n n ˈ ˈ tj tj ʊər ʊər ɒ ɒ ŋ ŋ ,   ˈ ˈ b b ɪ ɪ n n tj tj ʊr ʊr ɒ ɒ ŋ ŋ / , [bin-TURE-ong,BIN-ture-ong] bin- TURE TURE -ong, BIN BIN -ture-ong ), also known as the bearcat bearcat , is a [viverrid] viverrid native to [South] South and [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia . It is uncommon in much of its range, and has been assessed as [Vulnerable] Vulnerable on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List because of a declining population. It is estimated to have declined at least 30% since the mid-1980s. The binturong is the only [species] species in the [genus] genus  Arctictis Arctictis Arctictis .
== Etymology ==
""Binturong"" is its common name in Borneo, and is related to the Western [Malayo-Polynesian] Malayo-Polynesian root ""ma-tuRun"". In [Riau] Riau , it is called ""benturong"" and ""tenturun"". The scientific name Arctictis Arctictis means 'bear-weasel', from the Greek arkt- [arkt-] arkt- ""bear"" + iktis [iktis] iktis ""weasel"". 
== Taxonomy ==
Viverra binturong Viverra binturong was the [scientific name] scientific name proposed by [Thomas Stamford Raffles] Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822 for a specimen from [Malacca] Malacca . The generic name Arctictis Arctictis was proposed by [Coenraad Jacob Temminck] Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824.  Arctictis Arctictis is a [monotypic taxon] monotypic taxon ; its [morphology] morphology is similar to that of members of the genera Paradoxurus [Paradoxurus] Paradoxurus and Paguma [Paguma] Paguma . 
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the following zoological specimens were described: 
Nine [subspecies] subspecies have been recognized forming two [clades] clades . The northern clade in mainland Asia is separated from the [Sundaic] Sundaic clade by the [Isthmus of Kra] Isthmus of Kra . 
== Characteristics ==
The binturong is long and heavy, with short, stout legs. It has a thick coat of coarse black hair. The bushy and [prehensile tail] prehensile tail is thick at the root, gradually tapering, and curls inwards at the tip. The [muzzle] muzzle is short and pointed, somewhat turned up at the nose, and is covered with bristly hairs, brown at the points, which lengthen as they diverge, and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face. The eyes are large, black and prominent. The ears are short, rounded, edged with white, and terminated by tufts of black hair. There are six short rounded incisors in each jaw, two canines, which are long and sharp, and six molars on each side. The hair on the legs is short and of a yellowish tinge. The feet are five-toed, with large strong claws. The soles are bare, and are [plantigrade] plantigrade ―applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length―and the hind ones are longer than the fore ones. 
In general build, the binturong is essentially like Paradoxurus Paradoxurus and Paguma Paguma , but more massive in the length of the tail, legs and feet, in the structure of the [scent glands] scent glands , and in the larger size of the [rhinarium] rhinarium , which is more convex with a median groove being much narrower above the [philtrum] philtrum . The contour hairs of the coat are much longer and coarser, and the long hairs covering the whole of the back of the ears project beyond the tip as a definite tuft. The anterior [bursa] bursa flap of the ears is more widely and less deeply emarginate. The tail is more muscular, especially at the base and, in colour, generally like the body, but commonly paler at the base beneath. The body hairs are frequently partly whitish or buff, giving a speckled appearance to the pelage, sometimes so pale that the whole body is mostly straw-coloured or grey. The young are often paler than the adults, but the head is always closely speckled with grey or buff. The long mystacial [vibrissae] vibrissae are conspicuously white, and there is a white rim on the summit of the otherwise black ear. The glandular area is whitish. 
The tail is nearly as long as the head and body. The body ranges from 71 to 84 cm (28 to 33 in) and the tail is from 66 to 69 cm (26 to 27 in) long. Some captive binturongs measured from 75 to 90 cm (30 to 35 in) in head and body, with a tail of 71 cm (2 ft 4 in). The mean weight of captive adult females is 21.9 kg (48 lb), with a range from 11 to 32 kg (24 to 71 lb). [Captive animals] Captive animals often weigh more than their wild counterparts. 12 captive female binturongs were found to weigh a mean of 24.4 kg (54 lb) while 22 males weighed a mean of 19.3 kg (43 lb). In one study, the estimated mean weight of wild females was 10.5 kg (23 lb). However, seven wild male binturongs in Thailand were found to weigh a mean of 13.3 kg (29 lb), while one female was of similar weight at 13.5 kg (30 lb). One estimate of the mean body mass of wild binturongs was 15 kg (33 lb). 
Both sexes have [scent glands] scent glands —females on either side of the [vulva] vulva , and males between the [scrotum] scrotum and [penis] penis . The musk glands emit an odor reminiscent of [popcorn] popcorn or corn chips, described as ""ltpɨt"" by the Malaysian [Jahai people] Jahai people , likely due to the volatile compound [2-acetyl-1-pyrroline] 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in the urine, which is also produced in the [Maillard reaction] Maillard reaction at high temperatures.  Unlike most other carnivorans, the male binturong does not have a [baculum] baculum . 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The binturong occurs from [India] India , [Nepal] Nepal , [Bangladesh] Bangladesh , [Bhutan] Bhutan , [Myanmar] Myanmar , [Thailand] Thailand and [Malaysia] Malaysia to [Laos] Laos , [Cambodia] Cambodia , [Vietnam] Vietnam and [Yunnan] Yunnan in [China] China , [Sumatra] Sumatra , [Kalimantan] Kalimantan and [Java] Java in [Indonesia] Indonesia , to [Palawan] Palawan in the [Philippines] Philippines . It is confined to tall forest. In [Assam] Assam , it is common in foothills and hills with good tree cover, but less so in the forested plains. It has been recorded in [Manas National Park] Manas National Park , in Dulung and Kakoi Reserved Forests of the [Lakhimpur district] Lakhimpur district , in the hill forests of [Karbi Anglong] Karbi Anglong , [North Cachar Hills] North Cachar Hills , [Cachar] Cachar and [Hailakandi Districts] Hailakandi Districts . It was also recorded in [Kaziranga National Park] Kaziranga National Park in the year 2024. 
In Myanmar, binturongs were photographed on the ground in [Tanintharyi Nature Reserve] Tanintharyi Nature Reserve , at an elevation of 60 m (200 ft) in the [Hukaung Valley] Hukaung Valley , at elevations from 220–280 m (720–920 ft) in the [Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve] Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve , and at 580 m (1,900 ft) and at three other sites up to 1,190 m (3,900 ft) elevation. In Thailand's [Khao Yai National Park] Khao Yai National Park , several individuals were observed feeding in a [fig] fig tree and on a [vine] vine . In Laos, they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest. In Malaysia, binturongs were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that was logged in the 1970s. In Palawan, it inhabits primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland–forest mosaic from sea level to 400 m (1,300 ft). 
== Ecology and behavior ==
The binturong is active during the day and at night. Three sightings in [Pakke Tiger Reserve] Pakke Tiger Reserve were by day.  [Camera traps] Camera traps set up in Myanmar captured thirteen animals, one around dusk, seven at night and five in broad daylight. All the photographs were of single animals, and all were taken on the ground. Because binturongs are not very nimble, they may have to descend to the ground relatively frequently when moving between trees. 
Five [radio-collared] radio-collared binturongs in the [Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary] Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary exhibited an arrhythmic activity dominated by [crepuscular] crepuscular and nocturnal tendencies with peaks in the early morning and late evening. Reduced activity periods occurred from midday to late afternoon. They moved between 25 m (82 ft) and 2,698 m (8,852 ft) daily in the dry season and increased their daily movement to 4,143 m (13,593 ft) in the wet season. Range size of males varied between 0.9 and 6.1 km (0.35 and 2.36 sq mi). Two males showed slightly larger ranges in the wet season. Their ranges overlapped between 30 and 70%. The average home range of a radio-collared female in the [Khao Yai National Park] Khao Yai National Park was estimated at 4 km (1.5 sq mi), and the one of a male at 4.5 to 20.5 km (1.7 to 7.9 sq mi). 
The binturong is essentially [arboreal] arboreal . [Pocock] Pocock observed the behaviour of several captive individuals in the [London Zoological Gardens] London Zoological Gardens . When resting, they lay curled up with their heads tucked under their tails. They seldom leaped, but climbed skilfully, albeit slowly, progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branches or, upside down, beneath them. The prehensile tail was always ready as an aid. They descended the vertical bars of the cage head first, gripping them between their paws and using the prehensile tail as a check. They growled fiercely when irritated, and when on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunts or a hissing sound, made by expelling air through partially opened lips. 
The binturong uses its tail to [communicate] communicate . It moves about gently, clinging to a branch, often coming to a stop, and often using the tail to keep balance. It shows a pronounced [comfort behaviour] comfort behaviour associated with grooming the fur, shaking and licking its hair, and scratching. Shaking is the most characteristic element of comfort behaviour. 
=== Diet ===
The binturong is [omnivorous] omnivorous , feeding on small mammals, [birds] birds , fish, [earthworms] earthworms , [insects] insects and fruits. It also preys on [rodents] rodents . Fish and earthworms are likely unimportant items in its diet, as it is neither [aquatic] aquatic nor [fossorial] fossorial , coming across such prey only when opportunities present themselves. Since it does not have the attributes of a [predatory] predatory mammal, most of the binturong's diet is probably of vegetable matter.  [Figs] Figs are a major component of its diet. Captive binturongs are particularly fond of [plantains] plantains , but also eat [fowls] fowls ' heads and [eggs] eggs . 
The binturong is an important agent for [seed dispersal] seed dispersal , especially for those of the [strangler fig] strangler fig , because of its ability to scarify the seed's tough outer covering. 
In captivity, the binturong's diet includes commercially prepared meat mix, [bananas] bananas , [apples] apples , [oranges] oranges , canned [peaches] peaches and [mineral supplement] mineral supplement . 
=== Reproduction ===
The average age of [sexual maturation] sexual maturation is 30.4 months for females and 27.7 months for males. The [estrous cycle] estrous cycle of the binturong lasts 18 to 187 days, with an average of 82.5 days. [Gestation] Gestation lasts 84 to 99 days. Litter size in captivity varies from one to six young, with an average of two young per birth. Neonates weigh between 280 and 340 g (9.9 and 12.0 oz), and are often referred to as shruggles.  [Fertility] Fertility lasts until 15 years of age. 
== Threats ==
Major threats to the binturong are habitat loss and [degradation] degradation of forests through [logging] logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses throughout the binturong's range. Habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands of the [Sundaic] Sundaic part of its range, and there is no evidence that the binturong uses the plantations that are largely replacing natural forest. In China, rampant [deforestation] deforestation and opportunistic logging practices have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether. In the Philippines, it is captured for the [wildlife trade] wildlife trade , and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption. In Laos, it is one of the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least [Vientiane] Vientiane . In parts of Laos, it is considered a delicacy and also traded as a food item to Vietnam. 
The binturong is also sometimes kept captive for production of [kopi luwak] kopi luwak . 
== Conservation ==
The binturong is included in [CITES Appendix III] CITES Appendix III and in Schedule I of the Indian [Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972] Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 , so that it has the highest level of protection. In China, it is listed as critically endangered. It is completely protected in Bangladesh, and partially in Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. It is not protected in Brunei. 
World Binturong Day is a yearly event held in several zoos and is dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation. It takes place every second Saturday of May. 
=== In captivity ===
Binturongs are common in zoos, and captive individuals represent a source of [genetic diversity] genetic diversity essential for long-term conservation. Their geographic origin is either usually unknown, or they are offspring of several generations of captive-bred animals. The maximum known lifespan in captivity is thought to be over 25 years of age. 
The [Orang Asli] Orang Asli of Malaysia has the tradition of keeping binturongs as pets.

Armadillo Lizard,Armadillo girdled lizard,"
The armadillo girdled lizard armadillo girdled lizard ( Ouroborus cataphractus Ouroborus cataphractus Ouroborus cataphractus ), also commonly known as the armadillo lizard armadillo lizard , the armadillo spiny-tailed lizard armadillo spiny-tailed lizard , and the golden-armadillo lizard golden-armadillo lizard , is a [species] species of lizard in the [family] family  [Cordylidae] Cordylidae . The species is [endemic] endemic to [desert] desert areas along the [western coast] western coast of [South Africa] South Africa . In 2011, it was moved to its [own genus] own genus based on molecular [phylogeny] phylogeny , but formerly it was included in the [genus] genus  Cordylus [Cordylus] Cordylus . It has the largest known genome of all squamates. 
== Description ==
The armadillo girdled lizard can be a light brown to dark brown in colouration. The underbelly is yellow with a blackish pattern, especially under the chin. Its size can range from 7.5 to 9 cm (3.0 to 3.5 in) in [snout] snout - [vent] vent length (SVL). It may grow to a maximum size of 8 in (20 cm) STL. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
O. cataphractus O. cataphractus is endemic to the [Succulent Karoo] Succulent Karoo biome in the Northern and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa, where it occurs from the southern [Richtersveld] Richtersveld to the [Piketberg Mountains] Piketberg Mountains and the southern [Tankwa Karoo] Tankwa Karoo . It inhabits rock outcrops mountain slopes, preferably on sandstone substrate. 
== Ecology ==
=== Diet ===
The armadillo girdled lizard feeds mainly on small [invertebrates] invertebrates , such as [insects] insects and [spiders] spiders , but sometimes also may take plant material. In captivity, it is commonly fed crickets. In the wild, its most common prey items are termites, especially Microhodotermes viator [Microhodotermes viator] Microhodotermes viator and [Hodotermes] Hodotermes mossambicus . Individuals in larger social groups tend to eat more termites than those in smaller groups 
=== Behaviour ===
The armadillo girdled lizard is [diurnal] diurnal . It hides in rock cracks and crevices. It lives in social groups of up to 30 to 60 individuals of all ages, but usually fewer. Males are [territorial] territorial , protecting a territory and mating with the females living there. 
The armadillo girdled lizard possesses an uncommon [antipredator adaptation] antipredator adaptation , in which it rolls into a ball and takes [its tail in its mouth] its tail in its mouth when frightened. In this shape, it is protected from [predators] predators by the thick, squarish scales along its back and the spines on its tail. This behaviour, which resembles that of the mythical [ouroboros] ouroboros and of the mammalian [armadillo] armadillo , gives it its taxonomic and [English] English common names. 
=== Reproduction ===
The female armadillo girdled lizard gives birth to one or two  [live young] live young ; the species is one of the few lizards that does not lay eggs. The female may even [feed her young] feed her young , which is also unusual for a lizard. Females give birth once a year at most; some take a year off between births.
One hundred and six individuals from 27 groups were marked and recaptured regularly from May until September 2002. The group that was greater in fidelity had a greater neighbouring distance. While the group that was less in fidelity had a less neighbouring distance. The neighbouring distance correlates to the fidelity of the armadillo girdled lizard species. 
Males follow either a prenuptial or postnuptial reproductive cycle. The more common cycle is prenuptial with high sperm count being in the fall and winter seasons. In the postnuptial cycle, males produce the most sperm in the late summer season. 
== Conservation ==
The species Ouroborus cataphractus Ouroborus cataphractus is classified by the [IUCN] IUCN as near threatened. This is mostly due to a general cessation of collection for the pet trade, which was a significant drain on populations but is now illegal. The armadillo girdled lizard is thought to be somewhat susceptible to fluctuations in its primary food source (termites), which in turn can be impacted by climatic events such as changes in rainfall patterns, as well as to habitat changes through invasive alien plant species and poor fire management.

Malayan Tapir,Malayan tapir,"
Acrocodia indica Acrocodia indica 
The Malayan tapir Malayan tapir ( Tapirus indicus Tapirus indicus Tapirus indicus ), also called Asian tapir Asian tapir , Asiatic tapir Asiatic tapir , oriental tapir oriental tapir , Indian tapir Indian tapir , piebald tapir piebald tapir , or black-and-white tapir black-and-white tapir , is the only living [tapir] tapir species outside of the [Americas] Americas . It is native to [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia from the [Malay Peninsula] Malay Peninsula to [Sumatra] Sumatra . It has been listed as [Endangered] Endangered on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List since 2008, as the population is estimated to comprise fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. 
== Taxonomy ==
The [scientific name] scientific name  Tapirus indicus Tapirus indicus was proposed by [Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest] Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1819 who referred to a tapir described by [Pierre-Médard Diard] Pierre-Médard Diard .  Tapirus indicus brevetianus Tapirus indicus brevetianus was coined by a Dutch zoologist in 1926 who described a black Malayan tapir from [Sumatra] Sumatra that had been sent to [Rotterdam Zoo] Rotterdam Zoo in the early 1920s. 
[Phylogenetic] Phylogenetic analyses of 13 Malayan tapirs showed that the species is [monophyletic] monophyletic . It was placed in the genus Acrocodia Acrocodia by [Colin Groves] Colin Groves and [Peter Grubb] Peter Grubb in 2011. However, a comparison of [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA of 16 [perissodactyl] perissodactyl species revealed that the Malayan tapir forms a [sister group] sister group together with the Tapirus [Tapirus] Tapirus species native to the Americas. It was the first Tapirus Tapirus species that [genetically diverged] genetically diverged from the group, estimated about [25] 25 million years ago in the [Late Oligocene] Late Oligocene . 
== Description ==
The Malayan tapir is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its hindquarters. Black hair covers its head, shoulders, and legs, while white hair covers its midsection, rear, and the tips of its ears; these white edges around the rims of the outer ear as is true of other tapirs. The disrupted coloration breaks up its outline, providing [camouflage] camouflage by making the animal difficult to recognize against the varied terrain and dense flora of its habitat; potential [predators] predators may mistake it for a large rock, rather than [prey] prey , when it is lying down to sleep. 
The Malayan tapir is the largest of the four extant tapir species and grows to between 1.8 and 2.5 m (5 ft 11 in and 8 ft 2 in) in length, not counting a stubby tail of only 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) in length, and stands 90 to 110 cm (2 ft 11 in to 3 ft 7 in) tall. It typically weighs between 250 and 320 kg (550 and 710 lb), although some adults can weigh up to 540 kg (1,190 lb). The females are usually [larger] larger than the males. Like other tapir species, it has a small, stubby tail and a long, flexible [proboscis] proboscis . It has four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. The Malayan tapir has rather poor eyesight, but excellent hearing and sense of smell.
The tapir's unique proboscis is supported by several evolutionary adaptations of its [skull] skull . It has a large [sagittal crest] sagittal crest , unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with elevated frontal bones, and a retracted nasal incision as well as retracted facial cartilage. This evolutionary process is believed to have caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the tapir's nasal chamber.
=== Vision ===
Malayan tapirs have very poor eyesight, both on land and in water, instead relying heavily on their excellent senses of smell and hearing to navigate and forage. Their eyes are small and, like many herbivores, positioned on the sides of the face. They have brown irises, but the [corneas] corneas are often covered in a blue haze; this corneal cloudiness is thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. This loss of transparency impacts the ability of the cornea to transmit and focus outside light as it enters the eye, impairing the animal's overall vision. As these tapirs are most active at night on top of having poor eyesight, this habit may make it harder for them to search for food and avoid predators. 
=== Color variation ===
Two melanistic Malayan tapirs were observed in Jerangau Forest Reserve in Malaysia in 2000. A black Malayan tapir was also recorded in Tekai Tembeling Forest Reserve in [Pahang] Pahang state in 2016. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Malayan tapir lives throughout the tropical lowland [rainforests] rainforests of [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia , including [Sumatra] Sumatra in [Indonesia] Indonesia , [Peninsular Malaysia] Peninsular Malaysia , [Myanmar] Myanmar , and [Thailand] Thailand .
[Pleistocene] Pleistocene  [fossils] fossils were found in [Java] Java and other locations accompanied by herbivores more typical of grasslands, indicating that it evolved in more open habitats and retreated to closed forests in later times. It was found in [Borneo] Borneo until at least 8,000 years ago during the early [Holocene] Holocene in the [Niah Caves] Niah Caves of [Sarawak] Sarawak , and some 19th century writers mentioned it as a contemporary species in Borneo, likely based on native accounts. It has been proposed to reintroduce the tapir to the island as a conservation measure. 
In the continent, the Malayan tapir was found in historical times as far north as [China] China . 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Malayan tapirs are primarily solitary, marking out large tracts of land as their [territory] territory , though these areas usually overlap with those of other individuals. Tapirs mark out their territories by [spraying urine] spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth. Exclusively [herbivorous] herbivorous , the animal forages for the tender shoots and leaves of more than 115 species of plants, of which around 30 are particularly preferred, moving slowly through the [forest] forest and pausing often to eat and note the scents left behind by other tapirs in the area. The tapir can run quickly when threatened or frightened, and if forced to fight can defend itself with its strong jaws and sharp teeth. Malayan tapirs communicate with high-pitched squeaks and whistles. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Tapirs are mainly active at night, though they are not exclusively [nocturnal] nocturnal ; because they tend to eat soon after sunset or before sunrise, and they will often nap in the middle of the night, they are considered to be [crepuscular] crepuscular animals.
=== Life cycle ===
The [gestation] gestation period of the Malayan tapir is about 390–395 days, after which a single calf is born that weighs around 6.8 kg (15 lb). Malayan tapirs are the largest of the four tapir species at birth and tend to grow more quickly than their relatives. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern that enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. This baby coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. [Weaning] Weaning occurs between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach [sexual maturity] sexual maturity around age three. [Breeding] Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity. 
=== Predators ===
Because of its size, the Malayan tapir has few natural predators, and even reports of killings by [tigers] tigers ( Panthera tigris Panthera tigris ) are scarce. Malayan tapirs can defend themselves with their very powerful bite; in 1998, the bite of a captive female Malayan tapir severed off a zookeeper's left arm at the mid-bicep, likely because she stood between her and her offspring. 
== Threats ==
The main threats to the Malayan tapir are loss and [destruction of habitat] destruction of habitat through [deforestation] deforestation . Large tracts of forests in Thailand and Malaysia have been converted for planting [oil palms] oil palms . Habitat fragmentation in peninsular Malaysia caused displacement of 142 Malayan tapirs between 2006 and 2010; some were rescued and relocated, while 15 of them were [killed in vehicle collisions] killed in vehicle collisions .

Irrawaddy Dolphin,Irrawaddy dolphin,"
The Irrawaddy dolphin Irrawaddy dolphin ( Orcaella brevirostris Orcaella brevirostris Orcaella brevirostris ) is a [euryhaline] euryhaline species of [oceanic dolphin] oceanic dolphin found in scattered subpopulations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers in parts of the [Bay of Bengal] Bay of Bengal and [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia . It closely resembles the [Australian snubfin dolphin] Australian snubfin dolphin (of the same genus, Orcaella [Orcaella] Orcaella ), which was not described as a separate species until 2005. It has a slate blue to a slate gray color. Although found in much of the riverine and marine zones of South and Southeast Asia, the only concentrated lagoon populations are found in [Chilika Lake] Chilika Lake in [Odisha] Odisha , [India] India and [Songkhla Lake] Songkhla Lake in southern [Thailand] Thailand . 
== Taxonomy ==
One of the earliest recorded descriptions of the Irrawaddy dolphin was by [Sir Richard Owen] Sir Richard Owen in 1866 based on a specimen found in 1852, in the harbour of [Visakhapatnam] Visakhapatnam on the east coast of India. It is one of two species in its genus. It has sometimes been listed variously in a family containing just itself and in the [Monodontidae] Monodontidae and [Delphinapteridae] Delphinapteridae . Widespread agreement now exists  to list it in the family [Delphinidae] Delphinidae .
== Etymology ==
The species' name brevirostris brevirostris is from the [Latin] Latin meaning short-beaked. 
== Description ==
The Irrawaddy dolphin's colour is grey to dark slate blue, paler underneath, without a distinctive pattern. The dorsal fin is small and rounded behind the middle of the back. The forehead is high and rounded; the beak is lacking. The front of its snout is blunt. The flippers are broad and rounded. The [finless porpoise] finless porpoise ( Neophocaena phocaenoides Neophocaena phocaenoides ) is similar and has no back fin; the [humpback dolphin] humpback dolphin ( Sousa chinensis Sousa chinensis ) is larger, and has a longer beak and a larger dorsal fin. It ranges in weight from 90 to 200 kg (200 to 440 lb) with a length of 2.3 m (7.5 ft) at full maturity. Maximum recorded length is 2.75 m (9.0 ft) of a male in Thailand. 
The Irrawaddy dolphin is similar to the [beluga] beluga in appearance, though most closely related to the [killer whale] killer whale . It has a large [melon] melon and a blunt, rounded head, and the beak is indistinct. Its [dorsal fin] dorsal fin , located about two-thirds posterior along the back, is short, blunt, and triangular. Dorsal fin shapes differ from one Irrawaddy dolphin to another. The flippers are long and broad. These dolphins are usually two-toned, with the back and sides being gray to bluish-gray and the belly lighter. Unlike any other dolphin, the Irrawaddy's U-shaped blowhole is on the left of the midline and opens towards the front of the dolphin. Its short beak appears very different from those of other dolphins, and its mouth is known for having 12-19 peg-like teeth on each side of the jaws. 
== Behaviour ==
Communication is carried out with clicks, creaks, and buzzes at a dominant frequency of about 60  kilohertz, which is thought to be used for [echolocation] echolocation . Bony fish and fish eggs, [cephalopods] cephalopods , and [crustaceans] crustaceans are taken as food. Observations of captive animals indicate food may be taken into the mouth by suction. Irrawaddy dolphins are capable of squirting streams of water that can reach up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in); this distinct behaviour has been known for herding fish into a general area for hunting. They do this sometimes while [spyhopping] spyhopping and during feeding, apparently to expel water ingested during fish capture or possibly to herd fish. Some Irrawaddy dolphins kept in captivity have been trained to do spyhopping on command. The Irrawaddy dolphin is a slow swimmer, but swimming speeds of 20–25 kilometres per hour (12–16 mph) were reported when dolphins were being chased in a boat. In a year, females can sometimes swim as fast as average of 45 km, males can swim up to average of 100 km. 
Most Irrawaddy dolphins are shy of boats, not known to bow-ride, and generally dive when alarmed. They are relatively slow moving but can sometimes be seen spyhopping and rolling to one side while waving a flipper and occasionally breaching. They are generally found in groups of 2-3 animals, though sometimes as many as 25 individuals have been known to congregate in deep pools. Groups of fewer than six individuals are most common, but sometimes up to 15 dolphins are seen together. Traveling and staying in groups not only enables Irrawaddy dolphins to hunt, but it also creates and maintains social bonds and allows copulation to occur. There are a few groups of dolphins in [Brunei Bay] Brunei Bay seen near the mouths of [Temburong] Temburong and Aloh Besar rivers which are tame and gather around fisherman boats that catch fish during the fishing season from around December to February. 
It surfaces in a rolling fashion and lifts its tail fluke clear of the water only for a deep dive. Deep dive times range from 30 to 150 seconds to 12 minutes. When 277 group dives were timed (time of disappearance of the last dolphin in the group to the emergence of the first dolphin in the group) in [Laos] Laos , mean duration was 115.3  seconds with a range of 19  seconds to 7.18  minutes. 
[Interspecific competition] Interspecific competition has been observed when Irrawaddy dolphins were forced inshore and excluded by more specialized dolphins. When captive humpback dolphins ( Sousa chinensis Sousa chinensis ) and Irrawaddy dolphins were held together, reportedly the Irrawaddy dolphins were frequently chased and confined to a small portion of the tank by the dominant humpbacks. In [Chilika Lake] Chilika Lake , local fishers say when Irrawaddy dolphins and [bottlenose dolphins] bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake. 
=== Mating ===
A female or male dolphin will attempt to pursue a mate for about a few minutes. They intertwine facing their bellies together and begin to copulate for 40 seconds. Once copulation has occurred, the dolphins will break away from each other and set off in different directions. 
=== Reproduction ===
These dolphins are thought to reach sexual maturity at seven to nine years. In the Northern Hemisphere, mating is reported from December to June. Its gestation period is 14 months; cows give birth to a single calf every two to three years. Length is about 1 m (3.3 ft) at birth. Birth weight is about 10 kg (22 lb). Weaning is after two years. Lifespan is about 30 years.
=== Feeding ===
There are plenty of food items that this dolphin feeds upon. They include fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. During foraging periods, herds of about 7 dolphins will circle around prey and trap their victim. These prey entrapments occur slightly below the water surface level. 
== Habitat and subpopulations ==
Although sometimes called the Irrawaddy river dolphin, it is not a true [river dolphin] river dolphin , but an [oceanic dolphin] oceanic dolphin that lives in [brackish water] brackish water near coasts, river mouths, and estuaries. It has established subpopulations in freshwater rivers, including the [Ganges] Ganges and the [Mekong] Mekong , as well as the [Irrawaddy River] Irrawaddy River from which it takes its name. Its range extends from the [Bay of Bengal] Bay of Bengal to [New Guinea] New Guinea and the [Philippines] Philippines , although it does not appear to venture off shore.  It is often seen in estuaries and bays in [Borneo] Borneo Island, with sightings from [Sandakan] Sandakan in Sabah, [Malaysia] Malaysia , to most parts of [Brunei] Brunei and [Sarawak] Sarawak , Malaysia. A specimen was collected at [Mahakam River] Mahakam River in [East Kalimantan] East Kalimantan , the local name pesut mahakam pesut mahakam comes from it. 
Presence of the species in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong's waters has been questioned as the reported sightings have been considered unreliable, and the easternmost of ranges along Eurasian continent is in [Vietnam] Vietnam .
No range-wide survey has been conducted for this vulnerable species; however, the worldwide population appears to be over 7,000. In India, Irawaddy dolphins are mostly found in [Chilika Lake] Chilika Lake . Known subpopulations of Irrawaddy dolphins are found in eight places, listed here in order of population, including [conservation status] conservation status .
== Interaction with humans ==
Irrawaddy dolphins have a [mutualistic relationship] mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with traditional fishers. Fishers in India recall when they would call out to the dolphins, by tapping a wooden key also known as a lahai kway lahai kway , against the sides of their boats, asking the Irrawaddys to drive fish into their nets. In Burma, in the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Irrawaddy dolphins drive fish towards fishers using [cast nets] cast nets in response to acoustic signals from them. The fishermen attempt to gain the attention of the dolphins through various efforts such as using a cone-shaped wooden stick to drum the side of their canoes, striking their paddles to the surface of the water, jingling their nets, or making calls that sound turkey-like. A pod of dolphins that agrees to work alongside the fisherman will entrap a school of fish in a semicircle, guiding them towards the boat. In return, the dolphins are rewarded with some of the fishers' [bycatch] bycatch . Historically, Irrawaddy River fishers claimed particular dolphins were associated with individual fishing villages and chased fish into their nets. An 1879 report indicated legal claims were frequently brought into native courts by fishers to recover a share of the fish from the nets of a rival fisher that the plaintiff's dolphin was claimed to have helped fill. 
=== Folk stories ===
Laotians and Cambodians have a common belief that the Irrawaddy dolphins are reincarnations of their ancestors. Some even claim that the dolphins have saved drowning villagers and protected people from attacks by crocodiles. Their beliefs and experiences have led the people of Laos and Cambodia to live peacefully alongside one another for ages. The West Kalimantan people have a similar story where the dolphins were naughty children that ate a pot of rice reserved for the shaman, but their mouths scalded and jumped into the water to cool themselves, but later transformed into these dolphins. 
Buddhist Khmer and Vietnamese fishermen have regarded the Orcaella Orcaella as a sacred animal. If caught in fishing nets, they release the dolphin from the rest of the catch. In contrast, Muslim Khmer fisherman kill them for food. This has led to the dolphin becoming reputed to recognize the local languages of the area and it approaching areas of the Khmer Muslim community with caution. 
== Threats ==
Irrawaddy dolphins are more susceptible to human conflict than most other dolphins that live farther out in the ocean. Drowning in [gillnets] gillnets is the main threat to them throughout their range. Between 1995 and 2001, 38 deaths were reported and 74% died as a result of entanglement in gillnets with large mesh sizes. The majority of reported dolphin deaths in all subpopulations is due to accidental capture and drowning in gillnets and [dragnets] dragnets , and in the Philippines, bottom-set crabnets. In Burma, [electrofishing] electrofishing , [gold mining] gold mining , and dam building are also serious and continuing threats. Though most fishers are sympathetic to the dolphins' plight,  abandoning their traditional livelihood is difficult for them. 
Another identified threat towards the Irrawaddy dolphins was noise pollution from high-speed vessels. This caused the dolphins to dive significantly longer than usual. The Irrawaddy dolphins always changed directions when they encountered these large vessels. 
In recent years, Laotians and Cambodians developed techniques of using explosives for fishing. The government of Laos has made use of such tactics illegal, but few regulations have been made in neighboring Cambodia, where explosives are sold in local markets and the practice of using fishnets has been abandoned. The practice of using explosives instead has become very popular and led to a steady decline of populations of fish, and especially the dolphins swimming in the area. Although Laotians may not use explosives, they do use nylon gillnets, which pose another large threat to the survival of the Irrawaddy. Some dolphins accidentally become entangled in the net. Poor fishermen refuse to cut and destroy their nets because it would result in too great of an economic loss to save one Irrawaddy dolphin. 
In Laos, a dam across the Mekong River is planned. This could threaten the existence of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins in downstream Cambodia. Laos's government decision is to forge the dam upstream of the core habitat of the Irrawaddy dolphins. This could precipitate the extinction of this specific species in the Mekong River. The dam builders' proposal is to use explosives to dig out the tons of rock. This will create strong sound waves that could possibly kill the Irrawaddy dolphins due to their highly sensitive hearing structures. 
In several Asian countries, Irrawaddy dolphins have been captured and trained to perform in [public aquaria] public aquaria . Their charismatic appearance and unique behaviors, including spitting water, [spyhopping] spyhopping , and [fluke-slapping] fluke-slapping , make them very popular for shows in [dolphinaria] dolphinaria . The commercial motivation for using this dolphin species is high because it can live in freshwater tanks and the high cost of [marine aquarium] marine aquarium systems is avoided. The region within and near the species' range has developed economically; theme parks, casinos, and other entertainment venues that include dolphin shows have increased.
In 2002, there were more than 80 dolphinariums in at least nine Asian countries. 
[Collateral deaths] Collateral deaths of dolphins due to [blast fishing] blast fishing were once common in [Vietnam] Vietnam and [Thailand] Thailand . In the past, the most direct threat was killing them for their oil.
The [IUCN] IUCN lists five of the seven subpopulations as [endangered] endangered , primarily due to drowning in fish nets. For example, the Malampaya population, first discovered and described in 1986, at the time consisted of 77 individuals. Due to anthropogenic activities, this number dwindled to 47 dolphins in 2007. In the Mahakam River in Borneo, 73% of dolphin deaths are related to entanglement in gillnets, due to heavy fishing and boat traffic. 
=== Tourism ===
The Irrawaddy dolphins in Asia are increasingly threatened by tourist activity, such as large numbers of boats circulating the areas in which they live. The development of tours and boats has put a large strain on the dolphins. 
=== Disease ===
Cutaneous nodules were found present in various vulnerable populations of Irrawaddy dolphins. A more precise estimate of the affected dolphins is six populations. Although the definite fate of this emergent disease is unknown, the species is at risk. 
== Conservation ==
The Irrawaddy dolphin's proximity to developing communities makes the effort for conservation difficult. Entanglement in fishnets and degradation of habitats are the main threats to Irrawaddy dolphins. Conservation efforts are being made at international and national levels to alleviate these threats.
=== International efforts ===
Protection from international trade is provided by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( [CITES] CITES ). Enforcement, though, is the responsibility of individual countries. While some international trade for dolphinarium animals may have occurred, this is unlikely to have ever been a major threat to the species.
Some Irrawaddy dolphin populations are classified by the IUCN as critically endangered; in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam (Mekong River sub-population), Indonesia (Mahakam River sub-population, Borneo), Myanmar (Ayeyarwady/Irrawaddy River sub-population), the Philippines (Malampaya Sound sub-population), and Thailand (Songkhla Lake sub-population). Irrawaddy dolphins in general however, are IUCN listed as an [Endangered species] Endangered species , which applies throughout their whole range. In 2004, CITES transferred the Irrawaddy dolphin from [Appendix II] Appendix II to [Appendix I] Appendix I , which forbids all commercial trade in species that are threatened with extinction. 
The [UNEP] UNEP - [CMS] CMS Action Plan for the Conservation of Freshwater Populations of Irrawaddy dolphins notes that multiple-use [protected areas] protected areas will play a key role for conserving freshwater populations. Protected areas in fresh water could be a particularly effective conservation tool and can facilitate management, due to the fidelity of the species to relatively circumscribed areas. The Action Plan provides details on strategies for mitigating [by-catch] by-catch that includes:
The Irrawaddy dolphin is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( [CMS] CMS ). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them, as well on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements. 
The species is also covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (MoU). 
=== National efforts ===
Several national efforts are resulting in the reduction of threats to local Irrawaddy dolphin subpopulations:
Portions of Irrawaddy dolphin habitat in the [Sundarbans] Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh are included within 139,700 ha (539 sq mi) of [three wildlife sanctuaries] three wildlife sanctuaries , which are part of the [Sunderbans World Heritage Site] Sunderbans World Heritage Site . The [Wildlife Conservation Society] Wildlife Conservation Society is working with the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests to create protected areas for the 6000 remaining dolphins 
Irrawaddy dolphins are fully protected as an endangered species under Cambodian fishery law. In 2005, The [World Wide Fund For Nature] World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) established the Cambodian Mekong Dolphin Conservation Project with support from government and local communities. The aim is to support the survival of the remaining population through targeted conservation activities, research, and education. In January 2012, the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, the Commission for Conservation and Development of Mekong River Dolphin Eco-tourism Zone, and WWF signed the Kratie Declaration on the Conservation of the Mekong River Irrawaddy Dolphin, an agreement binding them to work together, and setting out a roadmap for dolphin conservation in the Mekong River. On 24 August 2012, the Cambodian government announced that 180-kilometre-long (110 mi) stretch of the Mekong River from eastern Kratie province to the border with Laos has been stated as limit fishing zone which uses floating houses, fishing cages and gill nets are disallowed, but simple fishing is allowed. This area is patrolled by a network of river guards, specifically to protect dolphins. Between January and February 2006, a dozen Irrawaddy dolphins were found dead. The discovery of 10 new baby dolphins  on the coast of Cambodia was a relief and gave hope that the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins would make a comeback in population. Since the endangerment was evident, 66 guards have been posted on the coast of Cambodia to protect these dolphins, and only two deaths have been reported since these efforts. To make more efforts to keep these animals from going extinct, the use of fishing nets on the coast of Cambodia is banned, as well. 
The Irrawaddy dolphin (under the common name of snubfin dolphin, with the scientific name misspelled as Oreaella brevezastris Oreaella brevezastris ) is included the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule I, which bans their killing, transport and sale of products. A major restoration effort to open a new mouth between Chilika Lake and the Bay of Bengal in 2000 was successful in restoring the lake ecology and regulating the salinity gradient in the lake waters, which has resulted in increases in the population of Irrawaddy dolphin due to increase of prey species of fish, prawns, and crabs. 
A conservation program, entitled Conservation Foundation for the Protection of Rare Aquatic Species of Indonesia, focused on protecting the Irrawaddy dolphin population and their habitat, the Mahakam River. The program not only educates and surveys the public, but also  monitors the dolphin population and their habitat. A prime example of this is the establishment of patrols in several villages.
Some major concern for the population in the Mekong River has arisen due to numerous threats. In the 1970s, many Irrawaddy dolphins were slaughtered for oil, and soon after,  intensive fishing practices with explosives and gillnets began. As of now, the dolphins are protected in Cambodia and Laos Democratic Republic. Now, both explosive fishing and use of gillnets is restricted in many of the Irrawaddy dolphin's habitats. Canadian conservationist Ian Baird set up the Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project to study the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Laotian part of the Mekong. Part of this project compensated fishers for the loss of nets damaged to free entangled dolphins. This project was expanded to include Cambodia, after the majority of the dolphin population was determined to have been killed or migrated to Laos' southern neighbor. The [Si Phan Don] Si Phan Don Wetlands Project has successfully encouraged river communities to set aside conservation zones and establish laws to regulate how and when fish are caught. In April, after a 200-kg Irrawaddy dolphin was found dead on the coast of Laos, the death toll for Irrawaddy dolphins is now five in 2015. Usually, Irrawaddy dolphins are found dead with bruises and scars on their body, being killed by illegal poaching, but this Irrawaddy dolphin was found dead because of old age. She is the oldest and largest Irrawaddy dolphin researchers have discovered. The dolphin was 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in length and most likely in her late 20s. 

Myanmar's Department of Fisheries took charge in December 2005, and instituted a protected region in a 74 km (46 mi) segment of the Ayeyarwady River between [Mingun] Mingun and [Kyaukmyaung] Kyaukmyaung and created multiple provisions, as well. Protective measures in the area include mandatory release of entangled dolphins, prohibition of the catching or killing of dolphins and trade in whole or parts of them, and the prohibition of electrofishing and gillnets more than 91 metres (300 ft) long, or spaced less than 180 metres (600 ft) apart.  [Mercury poisoning] Mercury poisoning and habitat loss from [gold-mining dredging] gold-mining dredging operations in the river have been eliminated 
In 2000, Malampaya Sound was proclaimed a protected seascape. This is the lowest possible prioritization given to a protected area. Malampaya Sound Ecological Studies Project was initiated by the WWF. With technical support provided by the project, the municipality of [Taytay] Taytay and the Malampaya park management developed fishery policies to minimize the threats to the Irrawaddy dolphin from bycatch capture. Gear studies and gear modification to conserve the dolphin species were implemented. The project was completed in 2007. In 2007, the [Coral Triangle] Coral Triangle Initiative, a new multilateral partnership to help safeguard the marine and coastal resources of the Coral Triangle, including the Irrawaddy dolphin subpopulation in Malampaya Sound, was launched. In 2006, a new population was discovered in [Guimaras] Guimaras island in the Visayas. In 2015, another new population was discovered in Bago in [Negros Occidental] Negros Occidental , part of Negros island in the Visayas. 
In 2002, the Marine and Coastal Resources Department was assigned to protect rare aquatic animals such as dolphins, whales, and turtles in Thai territorial waters. To protect the dolphins, patrol vessels ensure boats stay at least 30 m (98 ft) away from dolphins and  no chasing of or running through schools of dolphins occurs. Many fishermen on the [Bang Pakong River] Bang Pakong River , [Prachinburi Province] Prachinburi Province , have been persuaded by authorities to stop [shrimp fishing] shrimp fishing in a certain area and 30 to 40 fishing boats have been modified so they can offer dolphin sightseeing tours. A total of 65 Irrawaddi dolphins has been found dead along the coast of [Trat Province] Trat Province in the past three years. The local fishing industry is blamed for the deaths of the dolphins. In January 2013, over a dozen dead Irrawaddy dolphins were found on the coast of Thailand. These dolphins were said to be dead because of a lack of oxygen. Dolphins are mammals, and unlike other animals that live in the sea, they must come to the surface for air. Many of the dolphins are found dead in the water, and others were washed ashore, said to have been dead for a few days. Also, in the first week of February 2013, as many as four Irrawaddy dolphins were found dead. The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry is studying artificial breeding options in 2022 to try to save the last herd of Irrawaddy dolphins in Songkhla Lake, which is on the verge of extinction after only 14 were found in the most recent survey. They also intend to list dolphins as a [protected species] protected species , Thailand's highest level of animal protection. 
In 2008, the Department of Forestry and Sarawak Forestry Cooperative in Sarawak established a protected area for Irrawaddy dolphins in Santubong and Damai (Kuching Wetland). Furthermore, they plan to establish more beaches in Miri as protected areas for them. The protection measures in the area include prohibition of catching or killing of dolphins and trade in whole or parts of them, and prohibiting the use of gillnets. The government may also start small- and medium-scale research of this species at [Sarawak Malaysia University] Sarawak Malaysia University with sponsorship from Sarawak Shell.
In 2012 in Vietnam, a group of scientists took in four Irrawaddy dolphins and provided them with medical care to see how they would survive. However, they found this to be the first case they saw of Irrawaddy dolphins  having bacterial infections. The bacterial infection, chorioamnionitis, is common in many marine animals, but when these few dolphins were taken in, the scientists discovered this same bacterial infection for the first time in this group of dolphins. This disease mostly affects animals that are pregnant because the infection occurs through the umbilical cord and goes into the maternal bloodstream. One of the dolphins  was pregnant and before her death was found circling around the bottom of the pool and was found dead early the next morning. This bacterial infection affects many organs in the body of the animal.

Wobbegong Shark,Wobbegong,"
Eucrossorhinus [Eucrossorhinus] Eucrossorhinus  Orectolobus [Orectolobus] Orectolobus  Sutorectus [Sutorectus] Sutorectus 
Wobbegong Wobbegong is the common name given to the 12 species of [carpet sharks] carpet sharks in the family Orectolobidae Orectolobidae . They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western [Pacific Ocean] Pacific Ocean and eastern [Indian Ocean] Indian Ocean , chiefly around [Australia] Australia and [Indonesia] Indonesia , although one species (the [Japanese wobbegong] Japanese wobbegong , Orectolobus japonicus Orectolobus japonicus ) occurs as far north as [Japan] Japan . The word wobbegong wobbegong is believed to come from an [Australian Aboriginal language] Australian Aboriginal language , meaning ""shaggy beard"", referring to the growths around the mouth of the shark of the western Pacific.
== Description ==
Wobbegongs are bottom-dwelling sharks, spending much of their time resting on the sea floor. Most species have a maximum length of 1.25 m (4.1 ft), but the largest, the [spotted wobbegong] spotted wobbegong , Orectolobus maculatus Orectolobus maculatus , and [banded wobbegong] banded wobbegong , O. halei O. halei , reach about 3 m (9.8 ft) in length.
Wobbegongs are well [camouflaged] camouflaged with a [symmetrical] symmetrical pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet. Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are often referred to as [carpet sharks] carpet sharks . The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes surrounding the wobbegong's jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. Wobbegongs make use of their camouflage to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of [ambush predators] ambush predators . Wobbegongs also have a powerful jaw with needle-like teeth that assist in catching reef fish and other sharks for food. The blood cells of several species of wobbegong have also been described. 
== Interaction with humans ==
Wobbegongs are generally not considered dangerous to humans, but have attacked swimmers, snorkelers, and scuba divers who inadvertently come close to them. The [Australian Shark Attack File] Australian Shark Attack File contains more than 50 records of unprovoked attacks by wobbegongs, and the [International Shark Attack File] International Shark Attack File 31 records, none of them fatal. Wobbegongs have also bitten [surfers] surfers . Wobbegongs are very flexible and can easily bite a hand holding onto their tail. They have many small but sharp teeth and their bite can be severe, even through a wetsuit; having once bitten, they have been known to hang on and can be very difficult to remove. 
In Australia, wobbegong skin is used to make [leather] leather . 
=== Captivity ===
Although most wobbegong species are unsuitable for home aquaria due to their large adult size, this has not stopped some of the larger species from being sold in the aquarium trade. Small wobbegong species, such as the [tasselled wobbegong] tasselled wobbegong and [Ward's wobbegong] Ward's wobbegong , are ""ideal"" sharks for home aquarists to [keep] keep because they are an appropriate size and are lethargic, enabling them to be accommodated within the limited space of a home tank, although they will consume tankmates, even quite large ones. Some aquarists, by contrast, see the lack of activity to be a drawback to keeping wobbegongs, and prefer more active sharks. Wobbegongs are largely nocturnal and, due to their slow metabolism, do not have to be fed as often as other sharks. Most do well on two feedings weekly. Underfed wobbegongs can be recognised by visibly atrophied dorsal musculature. 
== Genera and species ==
The 12 living species of wobbegong, in three genera, are:

Sun Bear,Sun bear,"
The sun bear sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus Helarctos malayanus Helarctos malayanus ) is a bear [species] species in the [family] family  [Ursidae] Ursidae (the only species in the genus Helarctos Helarctos Helarctos ) occurring in the [tropical forests] tropical forests of [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia . It is the smallest bear species, standing nearly 70 cm (28 in) at the shoulder and weighing 25–65 kg (55–143 lb). It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws, small, rounded ears and a short [snout] snout . The fur is generally short and jet black, but can vary from grey to red. The sun bear gets its name from its characteristic orange to cream-coloured chest patch. Its unique [morphology] morphology —inward-turned front feet, flattened chest, powerful forelimbs with large claws—suggests adaptations for climbing.
The most [arboreal] arboreal (tree-living) of all bears, the sun bear is an excellent climber and sunbathes or sleeps in trees 2 to 7 m (7 to 23 ft) above the ground. It is mainly active during the day, though [nocturnality] nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. Sun bears tend to remain solitary, but sometimes occur in twos (such as a mother and her cub). They do not seem to [hibernate] hibernate , possibly because food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. Being omnivores, sun bears' diet includes ants, bees, beetles, honey, termites, and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of fruits; [vertebrates] vertebrates such as birds and deer are also eaten occasionally. They breed throughout the year; individuals become [sexually mature] sexually mature at two to four years of age. Litters comprise one or two cubs that remain with their mother for around three years.
The range of the sun bear is bounded by northeastern India to the north then south to southeast through Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam in mainland Asia to Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the south. These bears are threatened by heavy [deforestation] deforestation and [illegal hunting] illegal hunting for food and the [wildlife trade] wildlife trade ; they are also harmed in conflicts with humans when they enter farmlands, plantations, and orchards. The global population is estimated to have declined by 35% since the 1990s. The [IUCN] IUCN has listed this species as [vulnerable] vulnerable .
== Etymology ==
The sun bear is named so for its characteristic orange- to cream-coloured, crescent-like chest patch. The [generic name] generic name  Helarctos Helarctos comes from two [Greek] Greek words: ήλιος ήλιος ήλιος ( hēlios hēlios hēlios , related to the sun) and αρκτος αρκτος αρκτος ( arctos arctos arctos , bear). Another name is honey bear, beruang madu beruang madu beruang madu in [Malay] Malay and [Indonesian] Indonesian , in reference to its habit of feeding on honey from honeycombs. ""Honey bear"" can also refer to the [kinkajou] kinkajou . 
== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The [scientific name] scientific name  Ursus malayanus Ursus malayanus was proposed by [Stamford Raffles] Stamford Raffles in 1821; he first described a sun bear from [Sumatra] Sumatra . In 1825, [Thomas Horsfield] Thomas Horsfield placed the species in a [genus] genus of its own, Helarctos Helarctos , when describing a sun bear from Borneo. 
=== Subspecies and distribution ===
H. annamiticus H. annamiticus , described by [Pierre Marie Heude] Pierre Marie Heude in 1901 from [Annam] Annam , is not considered a distinct [species] species , but is subordinated as a [junior synonym] junior synonym to H. m. malayanus H. m. malayanus . In 1906, [Richard Lydekker] Richard Lydekker proposed another subspecies by the name H. m. wardii H. m. wardii for a sun bear skull, noting its similarities to a skull from Tibet with a thicker coat, but the Tibetan specimen was later found to be an [Asian black bear] Asian black bear ( Ursus thibetanus Ursus thibetanus ). Genetic differences between the two subspecies are obscure and some authorities consider the species [monotypic] monotypic . 
=== Phylogeny ===
The [phylogenetic] phylogenetic relationships among [ursid] ursid species have remained ambiguous over the years. Noting the production of fertile [hybrids] hybrids between sun bears and [sloth bears] sloth bears ( Melursus ursinus Melursus ursinus ), it was proposed that Helarctos Helarctos be treated as a [synonym] synonym of Melursus Melursus . However, studies differed on whether the two species were closely related. The brown bear/polar bear [genetic lineage] genetic lineage was estimated to have [genetically diverged] genetically diverged from the two black bears/sun bear lineage around [6.72 to 5.54] 6.72 to 5.54 million years ago (mya); the sun bear appears to have diverged from the two black bears between 6.26 and 5.09 mya. and 5.89–3.51 mya.  [Nuclear gene] Nuclear gene  [sequencing] sequencing of bear species revealed that the sloth bear and the sun bear were the first Ursinae bears that [radiated] radiated and are not included in the [monophyletic] monophyletic  Ursus Ursus group; moreover, all relationships between the bears were well resolved.

== Characteristics ==
The sun bear is the smallest of all bear species. It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws, small rounded ears and a short [snout] snout . The head-and-body length is between 100 and 140 cm (39 and 55 in), and the shoulder height is nearly 70 cm (28 in). Adults weigh 25–65 kg (55–143 lb). The snout is grey, silver, or orange. The fur is generally jet black, but can vary from grey to red. The hair is silky and fine, and is the shortest of all bear species, suiting its hot [tropical] tropical habitat. The characteristic chest patch, typically U-shaped, but sometimes circular or spotlike, varies from orange or ochre-yellow to buff or cream, or even white. Some individuals may even lack the patch. Sun bears can expose the patch while standing on their hind feet as a threat [display] display against enemies. Infants are greyish black with a pale brown or white snout and the chest patch is dirty white; the coat of older juveniles may be dark brown. The underfur is particularly thick and black in adults, while the [guard hairs] guard hairs are lighter. Two whorls occur on the shoulders, from whence the hair radiates in all directions. A crest is seen on the sides of the neck and a [whorl] whorl occurs in the centre of the breast patch. The edges of the paws are tan or brown, and the [soles] soles are fur-less, which possibly is an adaptation for climbing trees. The claws are sickle-shaped; the front claws are long and heavy. The tail is 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) long. The [sympatric] sympatric Asian black bear has cream-coloured chest markings of a similar shape as those of sun bears and different claw markings. 
During feeding, the sun bear can extend its exceptionally long tongue to extract insects and honey. The teeth are very large, especially the [canines] canines , and the [bite force quotient] bite force quotient is high relative to its body size for reasons not well understood; a possible explanation could be its frequent opening of tropical [hardwood] hardwood trees with its powerful jaws and claws in pursuit of insects, larvae, or honey. The bite force is high for its size: a 50 Kg sun bear bites with a maximum force of 1907.3–2020.6 [Newtons] Newtons on the rear molar. The head is large, broad and heavy in proportion to the body, but the ears are proportionately smaller; the [palate] palate is wide in proportion to the [skull] skull . The overall unique morphology of this bear, such as its inward-turned front feet, flattened chest, and powerful fore limbs with large claws, indicates adaptations for extensive climbing. 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
Sun bears lead the most [arboreal] arboreal (tree-living) lifestyle among all bears. They are mainly active during the day, although [nocturnality] nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. The sun bear is an excellent climber; it sunbathes or sleeps in trees 2 to 7 m (6 ft 7 in to 23 ft 0 in) above the ground. Bedding sites consist mainly of fallen hollow logs, but they also rest in standing trees with cavities, in cavities underneath fallen logs or tree roots, and in tree branches high above the ground. It is also an efficient swimmer. Sun bears are noted for their [intelligence] intelligence ; a captive bear observed sugar being stored in a cupboard locked by a key, and later used its claw to open the lock. A study published in 2019 described skillful mimicry of facial expressions by sun bears, with precision comparable to that seen in [gorillas] gorillas and humans. 
Sun bears are shy and reclusive animals, and usually do not attack humans unless provoked to do so, or if they are injured or with their cubs; their timid nature led these bears to be often [tamed] tamed and kept as [pets] pets in the past. Other sources, though, state that sun bears are known as very fierce animals when surprised in the forest. They are typically solitary but are sometimes seen in pairs (such as mothers and cubs). Sun bears stand on their hind feet for a broader view of their surroundings or smell far-off objects; they try to intimidate their enemies by displaying their chest patch if threatened. Vocalisations include grunts and snuffles while foraging for insects, and roars similar to those of a male [orangutan] orangutan during the breeding season; less commonly, they may give out short barks (like a [rhinoceros] rhinoceros ) when they are surprised. Sun bears do not seem to hibernate, possibly because food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. They occupy [home ranges] home ranges of varying sizes in different areas, ranging from 7 to 27 km (2.7 to 10.4 sq mi) in Borneo and [peninsular Malaysia] peninsular Malaysia ; and 8.7 to 20.9 km (3.4 to 8.1 sq mi) in Ulu Segama Forest Reserve in [Sabah] Sabah . Tigers are their major predators; [dholes] dholes and leopards have also been recorded preying on sun bears, but cases are relatively few. In one incident, a tiger-sun bear interaction resulted in a prolonged altercation and in the death of both animals. In another incident, a wild female sun bear was swallowed by a large [reticulated python] reticulated python in [East Kalimantan] East Kalimantan . 
=== Diet ===
Sun bears are omnivores and feed on a broad variety of items, such as ants, bees, beetles, honey, termites, and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of fruits.  [Vertebrates] Vertebrates such as birds, deer, eggs, and reptiles may be eaten occasionally. They forage mostly at night. Sun bears tear open hollow trees with their long, sharp claws and teeth in search of wild bees and honey. They also break termite mounds and quickly lick and suck the contents, holding pieces of the broken mound with their front paws. They consume [figs] figs in large amounts and eat them whole. In a study in the forests of Kalimantan, the fruits of [Moraceae] Moraceae , [Burseraceae] Burseraceae , and [Myrtaceae] Myrtaceae species made up more than 50% of the fruit diet; in times of fruit scarcity, sun bears switched to a more [insectivorous] insectivorous diet. A study in Central Borneo revealed that sun bears play an important role in the [seed dispersal] seed dispersal of Canarium pilosum [Canarium pilosum] Canarium pilosum (a tree in the family Burseraceae). Sun bears eat the centre of [coconut palms] coconut palms , and crush oil-rich seeds such as [acorns] acorns .  [Oil palms] Oil palms are nutritious but not enough for subsistence. 
=== Reproduction ===
Sun bears are [polyoestrous] polyoestrous ; births occur throughout the year.  [Oestrus] Oestrus lasts five to seven days. Sun bears become [sexually mature] sexually mature at two to four years of age. Reported lengths for [pregnancies] pregnancies vary from 95 to 240 days; pregnancy tends to be longer in zoos in [temperate climate] temperate climate possibly due to [delay in implantation] delay in implantation or [fertilisation] fertilisation . Births occur inside hollow tree cavities. A litter typically comprises one or two cubs weighing around 325 g (11.5 oz) each. Cubs are born deaf with eyes closed. The eyes open at nearly 25 days, but they remain blind till 50 days after birth; the sense of hearing improves over the first 50 days. Cubs younger than two months are dependent on external stimulation for defecation. Cubs are kept on [buttress roots] buttress roots at the base of trees until they learn how to walk and climb properly. Mothers protect their cubs aggressively. Offspring remain with their mother for nearly the first three years of their lives. Lifespan in captivity is generally over 20 years; one individual has lived for 34 years. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The sun bear is native to the [tropical forests] tropical forests of [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia ; its range is bound by northeastern India to the north and extends south to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam to Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the south. Its presence in China was confirmed in 2017 when it was sighted in [Yingjiang County] Yingjiang County of [Yunnan Province] Yunnan Province . It is [extinct] extinct in Singapore. 
These bears dwell primarily in two main types of forests throughout their range - [deciduous] deciduous and seasonally [evergreen] evergreen forests to the north of the [Isthmus of Kra] Isthmus of Kra , and nonseasonal evergreen forests in Indonesia and Malaysia. They are typically found at low altitudes, such as below 1,200 m (3,900 ft) in western Thailand and peninsular Malaysia, but this varies widely throughout the range; in India, larger numbers have been recorded at elevations up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) than in low-lying areas, probably due to habitat loss at ground level. They occur in montane areas in northeast India, but may not extend farther north into the unfavourable and colder [Himalayan] Himalayan region; their distribution might be restricted to the northwest due to competition with sloth bears. The sun bear is sympatric with the Asian black bear throughout the remaining areas in the mainland range featuring a mix of seasonal forest types, with monthly rainfall below 100 mm (3.9 in) for a long spell of 3–7 months. In mountainous areas, Asian black bears are more common than sun bears, probably due to scarcity of invertebrates on which to feed. The major habitats in southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia are [moist evergreen forests] moist evergreen forests , with more or less unvarying climate and heavy rainfall throughout the year, and low-lying or montane [dipterocarp] dipterocarp forests. [Mangroves] Mangroves may be inhabited, but usually only when they are close to preferred habitat types. 
The sun bear tends to avoid heavily logged forests and areas close to human settlement. However, sun bears have been seen in farmlands, plantations and orchards, where they may be considered [vermin] vermin . A survey in [Lower Kinabatangan Segama Wetlands] Lower Kinabatangan Segama Wetlands showed that sun bears were feared but were not common in oil palm plantations; [Bornean bearded pigs] Bornean bearded pigs , elephants and [macaques] macaques were far more damaging to crops. Sun bears have been reported preying on poultry and livestock. 
[Fossil] Fossil remains suggest its occurrence farther north during the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene ; it may have occurred as far south as [Java] Java in the middle to [Late Pleistocene] Late Pleistocene . Fossils also known from the Middle Pleistocene of Thailand along with Stegodon [Stegodon] Stegodon , [gaur] gaur , [wild water buffalo] wild water buffalo , and other living and extinct mammals. Today, it has been [eliminated] eliminated from the majority of its erstwhile range, especially in Thailand; populations are declining in most of the range countries. It disappeared from Singapore during the 1800s and 1900s, possibly due to extensive deforestation. Sun bear populations appear to decrease in size northward from [Sundaland] Sundaland , and numbers are especially low in the northern and western extremes of the range. This has possibly been the case since prehistoric times, and is not a result of human interference. The [population density] population density varies from 4.3 and 5.9 individuals/km (11 and 15 individuals/sq mi) in [Khao Yai National Park] Khao Yai National Park to 26 individuals/km (67 individuals/sq mi) in the [Harapan Rainforest] Harapan Rainforest in southern Sumatra. 
== Threats ==
According to the [IUCN] IUCN Bear Specialist Group, sun bear populations have fallen by an estimated 35% since the 1990s. Numbers are especially low in Bangladesh and China, and populations in Vietnam are feared to decline severely by 50–80% in the next 30 years. [Habitat fragmentation] Habitat fragmentation is on the rise, particularly in Borneo, Sumatra, and some areas of the mainland range. Heavy deforestation (due to agriculture, logging, and forest fires) and hunting for [wildlife trade] wildlife trade are severe threats throughout the range; human-bear conflicts are a relatively minor threat. Compared to other continents, Southeast Asia has undergone severe depletion in forest cover over the past few decades (by almost 12% between 1990 and 2010); this has resulted in substantial habitat loss for forest-dependent species such as sun bears. A 2007 study in [East Borneo] East Borneo recorded severe loss of habitat and food resources due to droughts and forest fires brought about by the [El Niño] El Niño . With lack of research in predation, sources have documented very few predation events. In the island of Borneo sun bears were found to be hunted by python in their most vulnerable state. Pythons are successfully able to attack by taking advantage of the nighttime when the sun bears are sleep or nursing their cub. In Southeast Asia, a male leopard ( Panthera pardus Panthera pardus ) has been photographed with a sun bear cub being held by the throat. This reported case has been reported to be the second confirmed predator as of 2019. During surveys in Kalimantan between 1994 and 1997, interviewees admitted to hunting sun bears and indicated that sun bear meat is eaten by indigenous people in several areas there. Studies have found evidence of pet trade and sale of sun bear parts such as [gall bladders] gall bladders in [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shops in Sabah and [Sarawak] Sarawak . In 2018 and 2019, 128 TCM outlets in 24 locations across Sabah and Sarawak were surveyed and bear parts and derivatives were recorded for sale in 25% of the outlets surveyed, many of which would have been derived from locally sourced sun bears. Sun bears were killed by shooting or administering poison to protect coconut and [snakefruit] snakefruit plantations in east Kalimantan. A report published by [TRAFFIC] TRAFFIC in 2011 showed that sun bears, along with Asian black bears and [brown bears] brown bears , are specifically targeted for the [bear bile] bear bile trade in Southeast Asia, and are kept in bear farms in Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Poaching is common in several countries in the region. Hunting pressure is rising even in some protected areas; in the [Nam Ha National Protected Area] Nam Ha National Protected Area in Laos, hunter snares have been found that specifically target bears. A study in [Nagaland] Nagaland (northeastern India) recorded a sparse distribution of sun bears in the Fakim and [Ntangki] Ntangki National Parks, and reported extensive illegal hunting for food and trade in bear parts. Protective laws have shown little success in controlling these threats, especially due to poor execution and high potential for gains by the trade. 
== Conservation measures ==
The sun bear is listed as vulnerable on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List , and is [included] included in [CITES Appendix I] CITES Appendix I . With the exception of Sarawak (Malaysia) and Cambodia, the sun bear is legally protected from hunting in its whole range. A 2014 report documented rampant poaching and trade in sun bear parts in Sarawak, more than anywhere else in Malaysia; the researchers recommended stricter legislations in the state to protect local sun bears. 
The [Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre] Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre , founded by [Wong Siew Te] Wong Siew Te in Sabah (Malaysia) in 2008, aims to work for the welfare of sun bears rescued from poor conditions in captivity and spread awareness about their conservation. The Malayan sun bears are part of an international captive-breeding program and a [species survival plan] species survival plan under the [Association of Zoos and Aquariums] Association of Zoos and Aquariums since late 1994. Since that same year, the European [breed registry] breed registry for sun bears is kept in the [Cologne Zoological Garden] Cologne Zoological Garden , Germany.

Andean Condor,Andean condor,"
The Andean condor Andean condor ( Vultur gryphus Vultur gryphus Vultur gryphus ) is a South American [New World vulture] New World vulture and is the only member of the [genus] genus  Vultur Vultur Vultur . It is found in the [Andes] Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America. With a maximum wingspan of 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in) and weight of 15 kg (33 lb), the Andean condor is one of the largest flying birds in the world, and is generally considered to be the largest [bird of prey] bird of prey in the world.
It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [comb] comb or caruncle on the crown of the head.  The female condor is smaller than the male, an exception to the usual [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism seen in [birds of prey] birds of prey .
The condor is primarily a [scavenger] scavenger , feeding on [carrion] carrion . It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [deer] deer or [cattle] cattle . It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [nests] nests at elevations of up to 5,000 m (16,000 ft), generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.
The Andean condor is a national symbol of [Bolivia] Bolivia , [Chile] Chile , [Colombia] Colombia , [Ecuador] Ecuador , and [Peru] Peru and plays an important role in the [folklore] folklore and [mythology] mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [vulnerable] vulnerable by the [IUCN] IUCN . It is threatened by habitat loss and by [secondary poisoning] secondary poisoning from lead in carcasses killed by hunters. [Captive breeding] Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.
== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Andean condor was described by [Swedish] Swedish scientist [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the [tenth edition] tenth edition of his Systema Naturae [Systema Naturae] Systema Naturae and retains its original [binomial] binomial name of Vultur gryphus Vultur gryphus . The Andean condor is sometimes called the Argentinean condor, Bolivian condor, Chilean condor, Colombian condor, Ecuadorian condor, or Peruvian condor after one of the nations to which it is native. The generic term Vultur Vultur is directly taken from the [Latin] Latin  vultur vultur or voltur voltur , which means ""vulture"". Its specific epithet is derived from a variant of the [Greek] Greek word γρυπός ( grupós grupós , ""hook-nosed""). The word condor itself is derived from the [Quechua] Quechua  kuntur kuntur . 
The exact [taxonomic] taxonomic placement of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of [New World vultures] New World vultures remains unclear. Although both are similar in appearance and have similar [ecological roles] ecological roles , the New World and [Old World vultures] Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to [storks] storks . More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order [Accipitriformes] Accipitriformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The [South American Classification Committee] South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from [Ciconiiformes] Ciconiiformes and instead described them as incertae sedis [incertae sedis] incertae sedis , but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. 
The Andean condor is the only accepted living species of its genus, Vultur Vultur . Unlike the [California condor] California condor ( Gymnogyps californianus Gymnogyps californianus ), which is known from extensive [fossil] fossil remains and some additional ones of [congeners] congeners , the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed [Plio-Pleistocene] Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of [Tarija Department] Tarija Department , Bolivia, may have been a smaller [palaeo subspecies] palaeo subspecies , V. gryphus patruus V. gryphus patruus . 
== Description ==
The overall length of the Andean condor can range from 100–130 cm (3 ft 3 in – 4 ft 3 in). Among standard measurements, the [wing chord] wing chord is 75.7–85.2 cm (29.8–33.5 in), the [tail] tail is 33–38 cm (13–15 in) and the [tarsus] tarsus is 11.5–12.5 cm (4.5–4.9 in). Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity. The mean weight is 11.3 kg (25 lb), with the males averaging about a kilogram more at 12.5 kg (28 lb), the females a kilogram less at 10.1 kg (22 lb). Condors possess the heaviest average weight for any living flying bird or animal, ahead of [trumpeter swans] trumpeter swans ( Cygnus buccinator Cygnus buccinator ) and [Dalmatian pelicans] Dalmatian pelicans ( Pelecanus crispus Pelecanus crispus ). However, other sources claim a mean species body mass of 10.3 kg (23 lb) for the Andean condor. The Andean condor is the largest living land bird capable of flight if measured in terms of average weight and wingspan, although male [bustards] bustards of the largest species (far more sexually dimorphic in size) can weigh more. The mean wingspan is around 283 cm (9 ft 3 in) and the wings have the largest surface area of any extant bird. It has a maximum wingspan of 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in). Among living bird species, only the [great albatrosses] great albatrosses and the two largest species of [pelican] pelican exceed the Andean condor in average and maximal wingspan. 
The adult [plumage] plumage is all black, except for a frill of white feathers at the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white bands on the wings, which only appear after the bird's first [moult] moult . The head and neck, kept meticulously clean, are red to blackish-red, and have few feathers. Their baldness means the skin is more exposed to the [sterilizing] sterilizing effects of [dehydration] dehydration and high-altitude [UV light] UV light . The crown of the head is flattened, and (in the male) is topped by a dark red comb (also called a caruncle); the skin hanging from its neck is called a wattle. Males also have yellower skin. When condors are agitated (for example, during courtship), their head and neck flush, a clear signal to animals nearby. This flush of colour is especially intense in dominant males when feeding at carcasses, and can happen in just a few seconds. Juveniles are grayish-brown, but with a blackish head and neck, and a brown ruff. 
The middle toe is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only slightly developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of [prehension] prehension as in birds of prey and [Old World vultures] Old World vultures . The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The [irises] irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. They have no eyelashes. Unlike the case with most other [birds of prey] birds of prey , the female is smaller. 
Observation of wing color patterns, and the size and shape of the male's crest, are the best ways of identifying individual Andean condors. Sighting-resighting methods assess the size and structure of populations. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Andean condor is found in [South America] South America in the [Andes] Andes and the [Santa Marta Mountains] Santa Marta Mountains . In the north, its range begins in [Venezuela] Venezuela and Colombia, where it is extremely rare, then continues south along the Andes in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, through Bolivia and western Argentina to the [Tierra del Fuego] Tierra del Fuego . In the early 19th century, the Andean condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego, along the entire chain of the Andes, but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity. Its habitat is mainly composed of open grasslands and alpine areas up to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) in elevation. It prefers relatively open, non-forested areas which allow it to spot carrion from the air, such as the [páramo] páramo or rocky, mountainous areas in general. It occasionally ranges to lowlands in eastern Bolivia, northern Peru, and southwestern Brazil, descends to lowland desert areas in Chile and Peru, and is found over [southern-beech] southern-beech forests in [Patagonia] Patagonia . In southern Patagonia, meadows are important for Andean condors as this habitat is likely to have herbivores present. In this region, Andean condor distributions are therefore influenced by the locations of meadows as well as cliffs for nesting and roosting. 
== Ecology and behavior ==
The condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its [primary feathers] primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The lack of a large [sternum] sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. In The Voyage of the Beagle [The Voyage of the Beagle] The Voyage of the Beagle , [Charles Darwin] Charles Darwin mentioned watching condors for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat [thermals] thermals to aid them in rising in the air. Flight recorders have shown that ""75% of the birds' flapping was associated with take-off"", and that it ""flaps its wings just 1% of the time during flight"". The proportion of time for flapping is more for short flights. Flapping between two thermal glides is more than flapping between two slope glides. 
Like other [New World vultures] New World vultures , the Andean condor has the unusual habit of [urohidrosis] urohidrosis : it often empties its [cloaca] cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through [evaporation] evaporation has been proposed as a reason for this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of [uric acid] uric acid . 
There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and [vocalizations] vocalizations . Generally, mature males tend to be at the top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom. 
=== Breeding ===
Sexual maturity and breeding behavior do not appear in the Andean condor until the bird is five or six years of age. It may live to 50 years or more, and it mates for life. During courtship displays, the skin of the male's neck flushes, changing from dull red to bright yellow, and inflates. He approaches the female with neck outstretched, revealing the inflated neck and the chest patch, while hissing, then extends his wings and stands erect while clicking his tongue. Other courtship rituals include hissing and clucking while hopping with wings partially spread, and dancing. 
The Andean condor prefers to roost and breed at elevations of 3,000 to 5,000 m (9,800 to 16,400 ft). Its nest, which consists of a few sticks placed around the eggs, is created on inaccessible ledges of rock. However, in coastal areas of Peru, where there are few cliffs, some nests are simply partially shaded crannies scraped out against boulders on slopes. It deposits one bluish-white [egg] egg , weighing about 280 g (9.9 oz) and ranging from 75 to 100 mm (3.0 to 3.9 in) in length. Breeding occurs about every second year, in the southern Andes around October, in the central and northern Andes it can be throughout the year. The egg hatches after 54 to 58 days of [incubation] incubation by both parents. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, another egg is laid to take its place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for hand-rearing, causing the parents to lay a second egg, which they are generally allowed to raise. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. 
=== Feeding ===
The Andean condor is a [scavenger] scavenger , feeding mainly on [carrion] carrion . Wild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling more than 200 km (120 mi) a day in search of carrion. In inland areas, they prefer large carcasses. Naturally, they feed on the largest carcasses available, which can include [llamas] llamas ( Lama glama Lama glama ), [alpacas] alpacas ( Lama pacos Lama pacos ), [rheas] rheas ( Rhea ssp. Rhea ssp. ), [guanacos] guanacos ( Lama guanicoe Lama guanicoe ), [deer] deer and [armadillos] armadillos . Wild individuals could acquire extra carotenoids from vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. However, most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals, which are now more widespread in South America, such as [cattle] cattle ( Bos taurus Bos taurus ), [horses] horses ( Equus caballus Equus caballus ), [donkeys] donkeys ( Equus asinus Equus asinus ), [mules] mules , [sheep] sheep ( Ovis aries Ovis aries ), [domestic pigs] domestic pigs ( Sus domesticus Sus domesticus ), [domestic goats] domestic goats ( Capra hircus Capra hircus ) and [dogs] dogs ( Canis familiaris Canis familiaris ). They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as [wild boar] wild boar ( Sus scrofa Sus scrofa ), [rabbits] rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus Oryctolagus cuniculus ), [foxes] foxes ( Vulpes vulpes Vulpes vulpes ) and [red deer] red deer ( Cervus elaphus Cervus elaphus ). For condors who live around the coast, the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals, largely [cetaceans] cetaceans . They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small, live animals, such as [rodents] rodents , [birds] birds and [rabbits] rabbits , which (given their lack of powerful, grasping feet or developed hunting technique) they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill. 
Coastal areas provide a constant food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as [corvids] corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures of the genus Cathartes [Cathartes] Cathartes —the [turkey vulture] turkey vulture ( C. aura C. aura ), the [lesser yellow-headed vulture] lesser yellow-headed vulture ( C. burrovianus C. burrovianus ), and the [greater yellow-headed vulture] greater yellow-headed vulture ( C. melambrotus C. melambrotus )—to carcasses. The Cathartes Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of [ethyl mercaptan] ethyl mercaptan , a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of [mutual dependence] mutual dependence between species. However, studies have indicated that Andean condors are fairly proficient at searching out carrion without needing to rely on other scavengers to guide them to it.  [Black vultures] Black vultures ( Coragyps atratus Coragyps atratus ) and several mammalian carnivorous scavengers such as [foxes] foxes may sometimes track Cathartes Cathartes vultures for carcasses or compete with condors over available carrion but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. A study in [Patagonia] Patagonia found surprisingly that condors were driving the ecology of [puma] puma ( Puma concolor Puma concolor ) in the area, apparently by routinely commandeering the powerful cat's kills (often the day following the puma's nighttime kills). It is projected that the condors were able to engage in harassment of the pumas despite the large cat's size and power, and has apparently driven the pumas to increase their kill rate in order to accommodate for their frequent losses to the scavengers. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its [ecosystem] ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. 
Andean condors can efficiently absorb a wide variety of [carotenoid] carotenoid pigments from the vegetal matter within the [viscera] viscera that they consume from carcasses. These include carotenoids such as [β-carotene] β-carotene and [echineone] echineone . The pigments result in the yellow skin colouration of adult males and their ability to flush their skin a brilliant yellow during contests for dominance, as well as the colour of the iris and bright orange tongues of both sexes. Captive Andean condors have a lower concentration of carotenoid pigments in their bodies than wild condors, likely because the diet of captive condors is usually restricted to just flesh. An analysis of the droppings of wild condors found that 90% contained vegetal remains, and of those that contained vegetal remains, 35% of them were composed of primarily vegetal matter (around 80% by volume). The potential sources for the vegetal matter is posited to include the viscera of herbivore carcasses as well as fresh vegetation. 
=== Longevity ===
Being a slowly-maturing bird with no known natural predators in adulthood, an Andean condor is a long-lived bird. Longevity and mortality rates are not known to have been extensively studied in the wild. Some estimations of lifespans of wild birds has exceeded 50 years. In 1983, the [Guinness Book of World Records] Guinness Book of World Records considered the longest-lived bird of any species with a confirmed lifespan was an Andean condor that died after surviving 72 years in captivity, having been captured from the wild as a juvenile of undetermined age. Several species of [parrot] parrot have been reported to live for perhaps over 100 years in captivity, but these (at least in 1983) were not considered authenticated. Another early captive-held specimen of condor reportedly lived for 71 years. However, these lifespans have been exceeded by a male, nicknamed ""Thaao"", that was kept at [Beardsley Zoo] Beardsley Zoo in [Connecticut] Connecticut . Thaao was born in captivity in 1930 and died on January 26, 2010, making him 79 years of age. This is the greatest verified age ever known for a bird. 
== Relationship with humans ==
=== Conservation status ===
The Andean condor is considered [vulnerable] vulnerable by the [IUCN] IUCN and the Peruvian [Conservation Organization] Conservation Organization . As a result of research on its plight, its status was changed to Vulnerable from Near Threatened in 2020, and only about 10,000 individuals remain.  It was first placed on the United States [Endangered Species] Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which stems from the fact that it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from [imprinting] imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive. 
In response to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the [US Fish and Wildlife Service] US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in [California] California . Only females were released to prevent it becoming an [invasive species] invasive species . The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place. 
In June 2014, local authorities of the [Ancasmarca] Ancasmarca region rescued two Andean condors that were caged and displayed in a local market as an attraction for tourists. 
=== Role in culture ===
The Andean condor is a national symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and [Venezuelan Andes] Venezuelan Andes states. It is the [national bird] national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It plays an important role in the [folklore] folklore and [mythology] mythology of the [South American] South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. c. 2500 BCE 2500 BCE onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting (""Yawar Fiesta"" or ""Blood Festival""), a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free. 
The Andean condor is a popular figure on [stamps] stamps in many countries, appearing on one for Ecuador in 1958, Argentina in 1960, Peru in 1973, Bolivia in 1985, Colombia in 1992, Chile in 1935 and 2001, and [Venezuela] Venezuela in 2004. It has also appeared on the coins and banknotes of Colombia and Chile.

Indian Pangolin,Indian pangolin,"
The Indian pangolin Indian pangolin ( Manis crassicaudata Manis crassicaudata Manis crassicaudata ), also called thick-tailed pangolin thick-tailed pangolin and scaly anteater scaly anteater , is a [pangolin] pangolin native to the [Indian subcontinent] Indian subcontinent . Like other pangolins, it has large, overlapping [scales] scales on its body which act as [armour] armour . The colour of its scales varies depending on the colour of the earth in its surroundings. It can also curl itself into a ball as self-defence against predators such as the [tiger] tiger . 
It is an [insectivore] insectivore feeding on [ants] ants and [termites] termites , digging them out of mounds and logs using its long claws, which are as long as its fore limbs. It is nocturnal and rests in deep burrows during the day.
It is not common anywhere in its range, and is threatened by hunting for its meat and various body parts used in traditional medicine. 
== Characteristics ==
The Indian pangolin is a solitary, shy, slow-moving, nocturnal mammal. It is about 84–122 cm (33–48 in) long from head to tail, the tail usually being 33–47 cm (13–19 in) long, and weighs 10–16 kg (22–35 lb). Females are generally smaller than the males and have one pair of mammae. The pangolin possesses a cone-shaped head with small, dark eyes, and a long muzzle with a nose pad similar in color, or darker than, its pinkish-brown skin. It has powerful limbs, tipped with sharp, clawed digits. The pangolin has no teeth, but has strong stomach muscles to aid in digestion. The most noticeable characteristic of the pangolin is its massive, [scaled] scaled  [armour] armour which covers its upper face and its whole body with the exception of the belly and the inside of the legs. These protective scales are rigid and made of [keratin] keratin . It has 160–200 scales in total, about 40–46% of which are located on the tail. Scales are 6.5–7 cm (2.6–2.8 in) long, 8.5 cm (3.3 in) wide, and weigh 7–10 g (0.25–0.35 oz). The skin and scales make up about one-fourth to one-third of the total body mass of this species. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Indian pangolin has been recorded in various forest types, including Sri Lankan rainforest and plains to middle hill levels. It inhabits grasslands and secondary forests, and is well adapted to dry areas and desert regions, but prefers more barren, hilly regions. In Sri Lanka, it was sighted at an elevation of  1,100 m (3,600 ft), and in the [Nilgiri mountains] Nilgiri mountains at 2,300 m (7,500 ft). It prefers soft and semi-sandy soil conditions suitable for digging burrows. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The Indian pangolin is [nocturnal] nocturnal and mostly active intermittently between 17:00 and 05:00 hr. The peak period of activity was observed between 20:00–21:00 hr in captive individuals with some individual variation. 
The Indian pangolin does not climb trees, but it does value the presence of trees, herbs, and shrubs in its habitat because it is easier to dig burrows around them. Features that promote an abundance of ants and termites like 
grasses, bare grounds, bases of trees, shrubs, roots, [leaf litter] leaf litter , fallen logs and elephant feces are often present in pangolin habitats. 
Pangolin burrows fall into one of two categories: feeding and living burrows. Feeding burrows are smaller than living burrows (though their sizes vary depending on the abundance of prey) and are created more frequently during the spring, when there is a greater availability of prey. Living burrows are wider, deeper, and more circular, and are occupied for a longer time than feeding burrows, as they are mainly used to sleep and rest during the day. After a few months, the pangolin abandons the burrow and digs a new one close to a food source. However, it is not uncommon for the pangolin to shift back to an old burrow. 
=== Diet ===
The Indian pangolin is an almost exclusive [insectivore] insectivore and principally subsists on ants and termites, which it catches with a specially adapted long, sticky tongue. It is [specialised] specialised to feed on ants and termites, but also forages for beetles and cockroaches. It feeds on the eggs, larvae, and adults of its prey, but eggs are the preferred choice. In the Potohar region of the Punjab province, the majority of its diet was found to consist of two types of ants, Camponotus confuci [Camponotus confuci] Camponotus confuci and Camponotus compressus [Camponotus compressus] Camponotus compressus . Other matter such as plant matter, stones, sand, and clay are consumed as well and in concert with strong stomach muscles aid in breaking down the food in the stomach. The Indian pangolin is nocturnal and uses its well-developed sense of smell to locate ant nests or termite mounds and other food sources. Foraging mostly takes place on the ground but may include [arboreal] arboreal ants, as seen in the rainforest canopy of Sri Lanka. Pangolins tear apart and dig into mounds by using the three centre claws on their forefeet, throwing loose soil backwards with their hind feet. When feeding, the rostral part of the pangolin's tongue is quickly inserted and withdrawn to capture prey. This movement is also used for drinking. 
=== Reproduction ===
Few details are known about the breeding behaviour of the Indian pangolin. During the animal's mating period, females and males may share the same burrow and show some diurnal activities. Males have testes in a fold of the skin located in their groin areas. The female's embryo develops in one of the uterine horns. The gestation period lasts 65–70 days; the placenta is diffuse and not deciduate. Usually, a single young is born, but twins have been reported in this species. The young weigh 235–400 g at birth and measure roughly 30 cm. The newborn animals have open eyes, and soft scales with protruding hairs between them. The mother pangolin carries her young on her tail. When the mother and young are disturbed, the young pangolin is held against its mother's belly and protected by the mother's tail.
== Threats ==
The Indian pangolin is threatened by [poaching] poaching for its meat and scales, which are used and consumed by local people, but are also increasingly [traded internationally] traded internationally . Various parts of the pangolin are valued as sources of food and medicine. The scales are used as an aphrodisiac, or made into rings or charms. The skins are used to manufacture leather goods, including boots and shoes. The majority of hunting is carried out by nomads and trained local hunters. Indian pangolin body parts have been trafficked for consumption in China since at least the early 2000s. Pangolins are the most heavily trafficked protected mammals. Other threats include [habitat loss] habitat loss , e.g. through [deforestation] deforestation .
== Conservation ==
The Indian pangolin is listed on [CITES Appendix I] CITES Appendix I since January 2017 and is protected in all range countries. 
=== In captivity ===
Successful reproduction by Indian pangolins has been reported from several zoos, including [Calcutta Zoo] Calcutta Zoo ,  [Oklahoma Zoo] Oklahoma Zoo , and [Nandankanan Zoological Park] Nandankanan Zoological Park . Pangolins were found to not show any significant morphological changes during pregnancy. Births in captivity have been reported throughout the year except for May and June. At birth a baby pangolin weighed 235 g and measured 30 cm in total length, including 12.5 cm of tail. A three-day-old Indian pangolin born at Oklahoma Zoo measured 310 mm from tip to tip with a 125 mm tail.

Star-nosed Mole,Star-nosed mole,"
Sorex cristatus Sorex cristatus  Linnaeus, 1758 Linnaeus, 1758 
The star-nosed mole star-nosed mole ( Condylura cristata Condylura cristata Condylura cristata ) is a small [semiaquatic] semiaquatic  [mole] mole found in moist, low elevation areas in the northeastern parts of North America. It is the only [extant] extant member of the tribe [Condylurini] Condylurini and genus Condylura [Condylura] Condylura , and it has more than 25,000 minute sensory receptors in touch organs, known as [Eimer's organs] Eimer's organs , with which this [hamster] hamster -sized mole feels its way around. With the help of its Eimer's organs, it may be perfectly poised to detect [seismic wave] seismic wave vibrations. 
The nose is about 1 cm in diameter with its Eimer's organs distributed on 22 appendages. Eimer's organs were first described in the [European mole] European mole in 1871 by German [zoologist] zoologist  [Theodor Eimer] Theodor Eimer . Other mole species also possess Eimer's organs, though they are not as specialized or numerous as in the star-nosed mole. Because the star-nosed mole is functionally blind, the snout was long suspected to be used to detect electrical activity in prey animals, though little, if any, empirical support has been found for this hypothesis. The nasal star and [dentition] dentition of this species appear to be primarily adapted to exploit extremely small prey. A report in the journal Nature [Nature] Nature gives this animal the title of fastest-eating [mammal] mammal , taking as little as 120 milliseconds (average: 227 ms) to identify and consume individual food items. Its brain decides in approximately 8 ms if prey is edible or not. This speed is at the limit of the speed of [neurons] neurons .
These moles are also able to smell underwater, accomplished by exhaling air bubbles onto objects or scent trails and then inhaling the bubbles to carry scents back through the nose. 
== Ecology and behavior ==
The star-nosed mole lives in wet lowland areas and eats small invertebrates such as [aquatic] aquatic  [insects] insects (such as the larvae of [caddisflies] caddisflies , [midges] midges , [dragonflies] dragonflies , [damselflies] damselflies , [crane flies] crane flies , [horseflies] horseflies , [predaceous diving beetles] predaceous diving beetles , and [stoneflies] stoneflies ), terrestrial insects, worms (such as [earthworms] earthworms , [leeches] leeches , and other [annelids] annelids ),  [mollusks] mollusks , and aquatic [crustaceans] crustaceans , as well as small [amphibians] amphibians and small fish.  Condylura cristata Condylura cristata has also been found in dry meadows farther away from water. They have also been found in the Great Smoky Mountains as high as 1,676 meters. However, the star-nose mole does prefer wet, poorly drained areas and marshes. It is a good swimmer and can forage along the bottoms of streams and ponds. Like other moles, this animal digs shallow surface tunnels for foraging; often, these tunnels exit underwater. It is active day and night and remains active in winter when it has been observed tunneling through the snow and swimming in ice-covered streams. C. cristata C. cristata is particularly adept at [thermoregulation] thermoregulation , maintaining a high body temperature in a wide range of external conditions relative to other Talpid moles. This explains its ability to thrive in cold aquatic environments. Little is known about the [social behavior] social behavior of the species, but it is suspected to be [colonial] colonial .
This mole mates in late winter or early spring, and the female has one litter of typically four or five young in late spring or early summer. However, females are known to have a second litter if their first is unsuccessful. At birth, each offspring is about 5 cm (2 in) long, hairless, and weighs about 1.5 g. Their eyes, ears, and star are all sealed, only opening and becoming useful about 14 days after birth. They become independent after about 30 days and are fully mature after 10 months. Predators include the [red-tailed hawk] red-tailed hawk , [great horned owl] great horned owl , [barn owl] barn owl , [screech owl] screech owl , [foxes] foxes , [weasels] weasels , [minks] minks , various [skunks] skunks and [mustelids] mustelids , and large fish such as the [northern pike] northern pike , as well as [domestic cats] domestic cats . 
== Snout comparison to visual organ ==
Vanderbilt University [neuroscientist] neuroscientist  [Kenneth Catania] Kenneth Catania , who has studied star-nosed moles for 20 years, recently turned his research to the study of star-moles as a route to understanding general principles about how human brains process and represent sensory information. He called star-moles ""a gold mine for discoveries about brains and behavior in general—and an unending source of surprises"".
Comparing the mole's snout to vision, his research showed that whenever the mole touched potential food, it made a sudden movement to position the smallest rays, the twin rays number 11, over the object for repeated rapid touches. He reports: ""The similarities with vision were striking. The star movements resembled [saccadic] saccadic eye movements—quick movements of the eyes from one focus point to another—in their speed and time-course. The two 11th rays are over-represented in the primary [somatosensory] somatosensory cortex relative to their size, just as the small visual [fovea] fovea in primates—a small region in the center of the eye that yields the sharpest vision—is over-represented in primary visual cortex."" He notes that some bats also have an auditory fovea for processing important [echolocation] echolocation frequencies, suggesting that ""evolution has repeatedly come to the same solution for constructing a high-acuity sensory system: subdivide the sensory surface into a large, lower-resolution periphery for scanning a wide range of stimuli, and a small, high-resolution area that can be focused on objects of importance"". 
The star-shaped nose is a unique organ only found on the star-nosed mole. Living as it does, in complete darkness, the star-nosed mole relies heavily on the mechanical information of its remarkable specialized nose to find and identify their [invertebrate] invertebrate prey without using [sight] sight (since moles have small eyes and a tiny [optic nerve] optic nerve ). This organ is often recognized by its high sensitivity and reaction speed. In only 8 milliseconds it can decide whether something is edible—in fact, this is one of the fastest responses to a stimulus in the animal kingdom and is the reason why the star-nosed mole was lately recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records [Guinness Book of World Records] Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s fastest forager.
=== Anatomy and physiology ===
The star-nose is a highly specialized sensory-motor organ shaped by 22 fleshy finger-like appendages, or tendrils, that ring their nostrils and are in constant motion as the mole explores its environment. The star itself is a centimeter across and thus has a diameter slightly smaller than a typical human fingertip. Nevertheless, it is much larger than the nose of other mole species, covering 0.92 cm (0.14 in ) per touch compared to 0.11 cm (0.02 in ) covered by the noses of other mole species. This structure is divided into a high resolution central fovea region (the central 11th pair of rays) and less sensitive peripheral areas. In this way, the star works as a ""tactile eye"" where the peripheral rays (1–10 on each side) study the surroundings with erratic [saccade] saccade -like movements and direct the 11th ray to objects of interest, just like the [primate] primate ’s foveating eye. 
Regardless of the [anatomical position] anatomical position of the star as a distal (protruding or extending) portion of the nose, this is neither an [olfactory] olfactory structure nor an extra hand. The appendages do not contain [muscles] muscles or [bones] bones and are not used to manipulate objects or capture [prey] prey . They are controlled by [tendons] tendons by a complex series of muscles that are attached to the [skull] skull in order to perform a role that seems to be purely mechanical. For this purpose, the star also contains a remarkably specialized [epidermis] epidermis covered entirely by 25,000 small raised domes or papillae of approximately 30–50 μm (0.0012–0.0020 in) in diameter. These domes, known as [Eimer’s organs] Eimer’s organs , are the only type of receptor organs found in the star of the star-nosed mole, which proves that the star-like structure has clearly a mechanical functioning.
Eimer’s organ is a sensory structure also found in nearly all of the approximately 30 species of mole, however none contains as many as in Condylura Condylura . This large amount of specialized [receptors] receptors makes the star ultrasensitive – about 6 times more sensitive than the human hand, which contains about 17,000 receptors.
Each Eimer’s organ is supplied by a number of primary [afferents] afferents , thus the star is densely innervated. It is associated with a [Merkel cell] Merkel cell - [neurite] neurite complex at the base of the cell column, a [lamellated corpuscle] lamellated corpuscle in the [dermis] dermis just below the column and a series of [free nerve endings] free nerve endings that originate from [myelinated] myelinated fibers in the dermis, run through the central column and end in a ring of terminal swellings just below the outer [keratinized] keratinized skin surface. All 25,000 Eimer’s organs distributed along the surface of the star have this basic structure in all 22 appendages. Nevertheless, the fovea region (11th pair of rays), which is shorter in area, has a lower density of these organs – 900 Eimer's organs on its surface while some of the lateral rays have over 1500. This may sound contradictory with the fact that this region has higher [resolution] resolution and an important role in [foraging] foraging behavior. However, instead of having more sensory organs, this fovea region uses a different approach where the skin's surface may be more sensitive to mechanoreceptic input; it has more innervation density. Rays 1 through 9 each have about 4 [fibers] fibers per Eimer's organ, while rays 10 and 11 have significantly higher innervation densities of 5.6 and 7.1 fibers per organ, respectively, revealing how the sensory periphery is differentially specialized across the star.
The myelinated fibers innervating the 11 rays were photographed and counted from an enlarged photomontage by Catania and colleagues. The total number of myelinated fibers for half of the star ranged from 53,050 to 93–94; hence the total fibers for the entire star vary from roughly 106,000 to 117,000. This means that tactile information from the [environment] environment is transmitted to the somatosensory neocortex rapidly. This would be insufficient without an adequate processing system, but in the star-nosed mole, the processing also occurs at a very high speed almost approaching the upper limit at which [nervous systems] nervous systems are capable of functioning. The threshold at which the mole can decide whether or not something is edible is of 25 milliseconds: 12 milliseconds to the neurons in the mole’s [somatosensory cortex] somatosensory cortex to respond to touch and other 5 milliseconds for motor commands to be conducted back to the star. In comparison, this whole process takes 600 milliseconds in humans.
The importance of the star-like nose in the mole’s lifestyle is evidenced in the [somatosensory] somatosensory representation of the nose. [Electrophysiological] Electrophysiological experiments using [electrodes] electrodes placed on the cortex during stimulation of the body demonstrated that roughly 52% of the cortex is devoted to the nose. This means that more than half of the [brain] brain is dedicated to processing sensory information acquired by this organ, even when the nose itself is only roughly 10% of the mole’s actual size. Thus, it may be concluded that the nose substitutes for the eyes, with the information from it being processed so as to produce a tactile map of the environment under the mole’s nose. As other [mammals] mammals , the somatosensory cortex of the star-nosed mole is somatotopically organized such that sensory information from adjacent parts of the nose is processed in adjacent regions of the somatosensory cortex. Therefore, the rays are also represented in the brain. The inferior most sensitive pair of rays (11th) had a larger representation on the somatosensory cortex, even when these are the shortest pair of appendages in the nose of the star-nosed mole.
Other important fact of the representation of the star in the [cerebral cortex] cerebral cortex is that each [hemisphere] hemisphere had clearly visible set of 11 stripes representing the contralateral star. In some favorable cases, a smaller third set of stripes was also apparent; opposite to other body structures that have a unique representation, with each half of the body represented in the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Thus, opposite to other species, the somatosensory representation of the tactile fovea is not correlated with anatomical parameters but rather is highly correlated with patterns of behavior. Recordings from active [neurons] neurons in the [somatosensory cortex] somatosensory cortex show that most [cells] cells (97%) responded to light tactile stimulation with a mean latency of 11.6 milliseconds. Besides a fairly large proportion of these neurons (41%) were inhibited by stimulation of proximate Eimer’s organs outside their excitatory receptive field. Consequently, the ability of the star to rapidly determine location and identity of objects is enhanced by small receptive fields and its associated [collateral inhibition system] collateral inhibition system that constrains [cortical] cortical neurons with short latency responses. 
In 1996, Vanderbilt PhD candidate Paul Marasco determined that the threshold by which the star-like structure senses the mechanical stimuli depends on which type of the Eimer’s organ was excited. He characterized three main classes of [Eimer’s receptors] Eimer’s receptors , including one of slow adaptation ( [Tonic receptor] Tonic receptor ) and two of rapid adaptation ( [Phasic receptor] Phasic receptor ). The tonic receptor has a response similar to that of a [Merkel cell] Merkel cell - [neurite] neurite complex. It has free terminals and is therefore able to detect [pressure] pressure and [texture] texture with a high sensitivity and at a Random Sustained Discharge. The rapid adapting responses include a [Pacinian] Pacinian -like response based on an (on-off) response caused by pressure and mechanical vibrations with maximum sensitivity to stimuli at a [frequency] frequency of 250 [Hz] Hz . The differences between both rapid responses rely on the fact that one of them only has a response during the compression phase. 
Among the receptors described, Marasco identified that there were receptors relatively unresponsive to compressive stimuli but were acutely responsive to any kind of [stimulus] stimulus that brushed or slid across the surface of the nose (Stimuli applied with large displacements and high velocity). In contrast, there were other receptors that responded robustly to small magnitude compression of any kind but were not responsive to sweeping stimuli. The receptors that were sensitive to sweeping were maximally activated across a broad range of [frequencies] frequencies from 5–150 Hz at large displacements ranging from 85 to 485 [μm] μm . Conversely, the receptors that respond to compressive stimuli showed a narrow peak of maximal activity at 250–300 Hz with displacements from 10 to 28 μm.
Based on the circular organization of the [nerve endings] nerve endings and its innervation pattern in Eimer’s organs, Marasco proposed by mapping experiments that nearly all receptors in the star-nosed mole have a preference for a particular direction of applied stimuli. Thus, while one receptor elicits a strong response if compressed in one direction, it may stay ""silent"" when compressed in another one.
Examination of the threshold of velocity at which the receptors responded identified that the minimum velocity of cell response was 46 mm/s, corresponding to the approximate speed of the nose during foraging behavior. 
Taking into account that Eimer’s organ senses mechanical deformation, its mechanism of [transduction] transduction can be explained in a few steps:
Although these summarized steps of mechanical transduction give a hint of how the star-nosed mole converts mechanical information into potential actions, the entire mechanism of transduction behind this intricate mechanoreceptor is still unknown and further studies are required.
=== Behavior ===
Despite the poorly developed eyes, star-nosed moles have an intricate system to detect prey and understand their environment. During exploration, the mole's star-like appendage produces brief touches which compress Eimer’s organ against objects or [substrate] substrate . When [foraging] foraging , moles search in random patterns of touches lasting 20–30 milliseconds. Catania and colleagues demonstrated that the [tactile] tactile organ of the star-nosed mole is preferentially innervated by putative light touch fibers. When the outer appendages of the star come into slight contact with a potential food source, the nose is quickly shifted so that one or more touches are made with the fovea (the two lower appendages; 11th pair) to explore objects of interest in more detail – especially potential prey. This foraging behavior is exceptionally fast, such that the mole may touch between 10 and 15 separate areas of the ground every second. It can locate and consume 8 separate prey items in less than 2 seconds and begin searching again for more prey in as little as 120 ms, although the average time is 227 ms.
The sequence described constitutes handling time. In studies made by high-speed video, the mole always foveated to the 11th appendage to explore a food item. The use of the 11th appendage of the tactile fovea is surprisingly similar to the manner in which human eyes explore details of a visual scene. 
This star-like nose also enables the mole to smell underwater, something which was previously thought impossible in mammals, which requires the inspiration of air during olfaction to convey odorants to the [olfactory epithelium] olfactory epithelium . Although the star-like structure is not a [chemoreceptor] chemoreceptor itself, it helps the star-nosed mole blow between 8 and 12 small air bubbles per second, each 0.06 to 0.1 mm in size, onto objects or scent trails. These bubbles are then drawn back into the [nostrils] nostrils , so that odorant molecules in the air bubbles are wafted over the [olfactory receptors] olfactory receptors . The speed of the bubbles is compared to other mole's speed of sniffing. Scientists found that the bubbles are being blown towards targets such as food. Before the star-nosed mole, scientists did not believe that mammals could smell underwater, let alone smell by blowing bubbles. 
In 1993, Edwin Gould and colleagues proposed that the star-like [proboscis] proboscis had [electroreceptors] electroreceptors and that the mole was therefore able to sense the [electrical field] electrical field of its prey prior to mechanical inspection by its appendages. Through behavioral experiments, they demonstrated that moles preferred an artificial worm with the simulated electrical field of a live [earthworm] earthworm to an identical arrangement without the electrical field. They suggested, therefore, that the nerve endings in the star’s tentacles are indeed electroreceptors and that the moles move them around constantly to sample the strength of the electromagnetic field at different locations as they search for prey. However, the hypothesis remains unexplained [physiologically] physiologically and has not yet been accepted by the scientific community. Instead, the hypothesis proposed by Catania, in which the function of the appendage is purely tactile, seems to be more feasible and is the one currently accepted.
=== Evolution ===
The development of the star-like appendages suggests precursors with proto-appendages on an ancestor's [snout] snout , which became elevated over successive generations. Although this [theory] theory lacks fossil evidence or supporting comparative data, nearly all extant moles have sheets of the [Eimer’s organ] Eimer’s organ making up the epidermis of their snout around the [nares] nares . Also, recent studies of Catania and colleagues identified one North American species ( Scapanus townsendii [Scapanus townsendii] Scapanus townsendii ) with a set of proto-appendages extending [caudally] caudally on the snout which exhibit a striking resemblance to the [embryonic stages] embryonic stages of the star-nosed mole, although Scapanus townsendii Scapanus townsendii has only eight subdivisions on its face, rather than the 22 appendages found on the star-nosed mole. Such change is of common occurrence in [evolution] evolution and is explained by the advantage of efficiently adding modules to the body plan without need to reinvent the [regulatory elements] regulatory elements which produce each module. Thus, although the star is unique in its shape and size, it seems feasible that the structure is based on a more ancestral [bauplan] bauplan as it comprises similarities found in a wide range of other moles and also in the [molecular structure] molecular structure of other mammals. 
The picture which emerges suggests that the star-nosed mole is an extreme in [mammalian evolution] mammalian evolution , having perhaps the most sensitive mechano-sensory system to be found among [mammals] mammals . There are two evolutionary theories concerning the star-like nose. One proposes the development of the structure of the star as a consequence of the [selective pressure] selective pressure of the star-nosed mole's [wetland] wetland habitat. Wetlands have a dense population of small insects, so exploiting this resource requires a higher resolution sensory surface than that of other moles. Thus, a shift to the wetland environment may have provided a selective advantage for a more elaborate sensory structure. Furthermore, in wild caught [moles] moles of many species, the Eimer’s organs show obvious signs of wear and abrasion. It appears that constant and repeated contact with the soil damages the [sensory organs] sensory organs , which have a thin [keratinized] keratinized epidermis. Star-nosed moles are the only species which live in the moist, muddy soil of wetlands where the less abrasive environment has allowed the delicate star-shaped structure to evolve. 
The second theory, that of prey profitability, explains the foraging speed of the star-nosed mole. Prey profitability (i.e. energy gained divided by prey handling time) is an essential variable for estimating the optimal diet. When handling time approaches zero, profitability increases dramatically. Due to the small [invertebrate] invertebrate prey available in the wetlands, the star-nosed mole has developed handling times as short as 120 ms. The dazzling speed with which it forages therefore counterbalances the low nutritional value of each individual piece of food and maximizes the time available for finding more. Further, the proximity of the star-shaped nose to the mouth greatly reduces the handling time required before food can be ingested and is a major factor in how the star-nosed mole can find and eat food so quickly. 
=== Current applications in engineering ===
The study of highly specialized systems often allows better insight into more generalized ones. The mole's striking, star-like structure may reflect a general trend in its ""less remarkable"" relatives, including humans. Little is known today about the molecular mechanisms of [tactile] tactile transduction in mammals. As the Drosophila [Drosophila] Drosophila fly is to genetics, or the [squid giant axon] squid giant axon is to neurobiology, the star-nosed mole may be the model organism for tactile transduction. The proper understanding of its [saccade] saccade -like system and associated transduction may lead in the future to the development of new types of [neural prostheses] neural prostheses . Furthermore, the outstanding speed and precision at which the mole performs may provide insights into the structural design of intelligent machines as an artificial response to the remarkable sensory ability of the star-nosed mole.
== Snout as related to optimal foraging theory ==
According to [optimal foraging theory] optimal foraging theory , organisms forage in such a way as to maximize their net energy intake per unit time. In other words, they behave in such a way as to find, capture and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. With extremely short handling times for eating very small prey, star-nosed moles can profitably consume foods that are not worth the time or effort of slower animals, and having a food category to themselves is a big advantage. Furthermore, just behind the 11th ray of the star, the star-nosed mole has modified front teeth that form the equivalent of a pair of tweezers. High-speed video shows these specialized teeth are used to pluck tiny prey from the ground. As Catania reports, ""It is also clear from the behavior that the teeth and the star act as an integrated unit – the 11th rays, located directly in front on the teeth, spread apart as the teeth move forward to grasp small food. Thus, tweezer-like teeth and the exquisitely sensitive star likely evolved together as a means to better find and handle small prey quickly...it appears that the ability to rapidly detect and consume small prey was the major selective advantage that drove the evolution of the star.""

Thorny Devil,Thorny devil,"
Acanthosaura gibbosus Acanthosaura gibbosus 
The thorny devil thorny devil ( Moloch horridus Moloch horridus Moloch horridus ), also known [commonly] commonly as the mountain devil mountain devil , thorny lizard thorny lizard , thorny dragon thorny dragon , and moloch moloch , is a [species] species of [lizard] lizard in the [family] family  [Agamidae] Agamidae . The species is [endemic] endemic to [Australia] Australia . It is the [sole species] sole species in the [genus] genus  Moloch Moloch Moloch . It grows up to 21 cm (8.3 in) in total length (including tail), with females generally larger than males.
== Taxonomy ==
The thorny devil was first [described] described by the biologist [John Edward Gray] John Edward Gray in 1841. While it is the only species contained in the genus Moloch Moloch , many taxonomists suspect another species might remain to be found in the wild. The thorny devil is only distantly related to the [morphologically] morphologically similar [North American] North American  [horned lizards] horned lizards of the genus Phrynosoma Phrynosoma . This similarity is usually thought of as an example of [convergent evolution] convergent evolution .
The names given to this lizard reflect its appearance: the two large horned scales on its head complete the illusion of a dragon or devil. The name [Moloch] Moloch was used for a deity of the [ancient Near East] ancient Near East , usually depicted as a hideous beast. The thorny devil also has other nicknames people have given it such as the ""devil lizard"", ""horned lizard"", and the ""thorny toad"". 
== Description ==
The thorny devil grows up to 21 cm (8.3 in) in total length (including tail), and can live for 15 to 20 years. The females are larger than the males. Most specimens are coloured in camouflaging shades of desert browns and tans. These colours change from pale colours during warm weather to darker colours during cold weather. The thorny devil is covered entirely with conical spines that are mostly uncalcified.
An intimidating array of spikes covers the entire upper side of the body of the thorny devil. These thorny scales also help to defend it from [predators] predators . [Camouflage] Camouflage and deception may also be used to evade predation. This lizard's unusual gait involves freezing and rocking as it moves about slowly in search of food, water, and mates. 
The thorny devil also features a spiny ""false head"" on the back of its neck, and the lizard presents this to potential predators by dipping its real head. The ""false head"" is made of soft tissue. 
The thorny devil's scales are ridged, enabling the animal to collect water by simply touching it with any part of the body, usually the limbs; [capillary action] capillary action transports the water to the mouth through channels in its skin. The thorny devil is also equipped to harvest moisture in the dry desert following nighttime's extremely low temperatures and the subsequent condensation of [dew] dew . The process involves moisture contact,  their hydrophilic skin surface structures with capillaries, and an internal transport mechanism. 
The same hydrophilic moisture-harvesting physiology is characteristic in the [Texas horned lizard] Texas horned lizard ( Phrynosoma cornutum Phrynosoma cornutum ), roundtail horned lizard ( Phrynosoma modestum [Phrynosoma modestum] Phrynosoma modestum ), desert horned lizard ( Phrynosoma platyrhinos Phrynosoma platyrhinos ), Arabian toad-headed agama ( Phrynocephalus arabicus [Phrynocephalus arabicus] Phrynocephalus arabicus ), sunwatcher toadhead agama ( Phrynocephalus helioscopus [Phrynocephalus helioscopus] Phrynocephalus helioscopus ), Phrynocephalus horvathi [Phrynocephalus horvathi] Phrynocephalus horvathi , yellow-spotted agama ( Trapelus flavimaculatus [Trapelus flavimaculatus] Trapelus flavimaculatus ), Trapelus pallidus Trapelus pallidus and desert agama ( Trapelus mutabilis [Trapelus mutabilis] Trapelus mutabilis ). 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The thorny devil usually lives in the arid [scrubland] scrubland and [desert] desert that covers most of [central Australia] central Australia , sandplain and sandridge desert in the deep interior and the [mallee belt] mallee belt .
The habitat of the thorny devil coincides more with the regions of sandy [loam] loam soils than with a particular climate in [Western Australia] Western Australia . 
== Self-defense ==
The thorny devil is covered in hard, rather sharp spines that dissuade attacks by predators by making it difficult to swallow. It also has a false head on its back. When it feels threatened by other animals, it lowers its head between its front legs, and then presents its false head. [Predators] Predators that consume the thorny devil include wild birds and [goannas] goannas .
== Diet ==
The thorny devil mainly subsists on ants, especially Ochetellus flavipes [Ochetellus flavipes] Ochetellus flavipes and other species in the Camponotus [Camponotus] Camponotus , Ectatomma [Ectatomma] Ectatomma ,  Iridomyrmex [Iridomyrmex] Iridomyrmex (especially Iridomyrmex rufoniger [Iridomyrmex rufoniger] Iridomyrmex rufoniger ),  Monomorium [Monomorium] Monomorium ,  Ochetellus [Ochetellus] Ochetellus , Pheidole [Pheidole] Pheidole , or Polyrhachis [Polyrhachis] Polyrhachis genera. Thorny devils often eat thousands of ants in one day. 
The thorny devil collects moisture in the dry desert by the condensation of dew. This dew forms on its skin in the early morning as it begins to warm outside. Then the dew is channeled to its mouth by gravity and [capillary action] capillary action via the channels between its spines. During rainfalls, capillary action allows the thorny devil to absorb water from all over its body. Capillary action also allows the thorny devil to absorb water from damp sand. Absorption through sand is the thorny devil's main source of water intake. 
== Reproduction ==
The female thorny devil lays a clutch of three to ten [eggs] eggs between September and December. She puts these in a nesting burrow about 30 cm underground. The eggs hatch after about three to four months. 
== Popular reference ==
The popular appeal of the thorny devil is the basis of an anecdotal petty scam. American servicemen stationed in [Southwest Australia] Southwest Australia decades ago (such as during [World War II] World War II ) were supposedly sold the thorny fruits of a species of weeds, the so-called ""double gee"" ( Emex australis [Emex australis] Emex australis ), but those were called ""thorny devil eggs"" as a part of the scam. Thorny devils have been kept in captivity.

Ribbon Eel,Ribbon eel,"
Rhinomuraena amboinensis Rhinomuraena amboinensis 
The ribbon eel ribbon eel ( Rhinomuraena quaesita Rhinomuraena quaesita ), also known as the leaf-nosed moray eel leaf-nosed moray eel or bernis eel bernis eel , is a [species] species of [moray eel] moray eel , the [only member] only member of the [genus] genus  Rhinomuraena Rhinomuraena . The ribbon eel is found in sand burrows and reefs in the [Indo-Pacific] Indo-Pacific Ocean. Although generally placed in the moray eel family [Muraenidae] Muraenidae , it has several distinctive features leading some to place it in its own family, Rhinomuraenidae. 
== Development ==
Ribbon eels are a diurnal species (active during the daytime). Characterized by its long, thin body and high [dorsal fins] dorsal fins . The ribbon eel can easily be recognized by its expanded anterior nostrils and wide-open jaws. These eels can have up to 255 vertebrae in their back bone, making them one of the most narrow and elongated eel species known. The ribbon eel larva is described as a large, greenish [leptocephalus] leptocephalus . Based on observed color changes, it is generally considered a [protandic hermaphrodite] protandic hermaphrodite (male to female transformation). When necessary, male ribbon eels will develop reproductive organs, lay eggs, and then die. This developmental stage happens within about a month. In their juvenile and subadult stages, ribbon eels appear primarily jet black with a yellow dorsal fin. In adult males, the black is replaced by a vibrant blue and yellow facial appearance. An adult female is entirely yellow or yellow with some blue to the posterior. Color change related to sex change is not known from any other moray eel species. The blue adult males range from 65 to 94 cm (26 to 37 in) in length, while the larger yellow females can reach up to 130 cm (51 in). It is presumed that even with its significant color changes throughout its development, coloring does not play a significant role in mating for a ribbon eel because the eels are colorblind (possessing only one of the two [photoreceptor cells] photoreceptor cells required to see colors). In its natural habitat, ribbon eels can live up to twenty years. 
== Habitat ==
Ribbon eels prefer more shallow-water areas compared to other moray eels, frequenting a depth range of 1 to 57 meters. This species is widely distributed and are seen by divers in Indonesian waters with their heads and anterior bodies protruding from crevices in sand and rubble habitats, like coral reefs, which they are able to slip through with their slime coat. Typically, ribbon eels can be found in tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Ocean, ranging from East Africa to southern Japan, Australia, and [French Polynesia] French Polynesia . 
== Taxonomy ==
The ribbon eel is the only one of its genus, Rhinomuraena Rhinomuraena , in the subspecies Muraeninae of the moray eel family. Its unique morphology, such as its [gonad] gonad structure and function are not shared with many of the other major genera in the family and provided evidence for separation. Typically, eels of the family urogenital system follow a posterior pattern toward the anus of the eel, but the Rhinomuraena Rhinomuraena system has its sex cells move anteriorly . . This change is presumed to be due to some evolutionary cause, like [peripatric speciation] peripatric speciation . Previously, R. quaesita R. quaesita was used to identify the blue ribbon eels and R. amboinensis R. amboinensis was used for black ribbon eels, but these are now recognized as the same species, R. quaesita. R. quaesita.
== Environmental Impacts ==
Ribbon eels are labeled ""least concerned"" on the [IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as of 2009. Recent studies on the effects of various environmental factors on marine eels have presented potential threats to the ribbon eel population. Marine eels that prefer to stay in shallower waters, specifically around coral reef habitats, are most at risk of suffering from the impacts of [coral bleaching] coral bleaching and other marine habitat damage caused by [climate change] climate change or human activity (i.e. pollution). The shift in habitat structure and diversity could make it harder for ribbon eels to find enough prey to survive and reproduce. [Overfishing] Overfishing is another concern as it can lead to a reduction in the number of ribbon eels and their available prey.
== Captivity ==
Most ribbon eels do not live longer than a year in captivity. Ribbon eels have been observed in many cases to stop eating after being captured and put into home aquariums. Higher levels of success have been achieved in [public aquaria] public aquaria , where there are a few reported cases of [spawning] spawning at facilities in Europe and North America. In captivity, the color differences are not related to maturity or gender. 
Although captured for the aquarium industry, it remains common and widespread, and is not considered threatened.

Marbled Polecat,Marbled polecat,"
The marbled polecat marbled polecat ( Vormela peregusna Vormela peregusna Vormela peregusna ) is a small mammal belonging to the [genus] genus  Vormela [Vormela] Vormela within the [mustelid] mustelid  [subfamily] subfamily  [Ictonychinae] Ictonychinae . Vormela Vormela is from the [German] German word Würmlein Würmlein Würmlein , which means ""little worm"". The [specific name] specific name  peregusna peregusna comes from perehuznya perehuznya perehuznya ( перегузня перегузня перегузня ), which is [Ukrainian] Ukrainian for ""polecat"". Marbled polecats are generally found in the drier areas and [grasslands] grasslands of [southeastern Europe] southeastern Europe to [western China] western China . Like other members of the Ictonychinae, it can emit a strong-smelling secretion from anal sacs under the tail when threatened.
== Description ==
Ranging in length from 29–35 cm (head and body), the marbled polecat has a short muzzle and very large, noticeable ears. The limbs are short and claws are long and strong. While the tail is long, with long hair, the overall [pelage] pelage is short.  Black and white mark the face, with a black stripe across the eyes and white markings around the mouth. [Dorsally] Dorsally , the pelage is yellow and heavily mottled with irregular reddish or brown spots. The tail is dark brown with a yellowish band in the midregion. The [ventral] ventral region and limbs are a dark brown. Females weigh from 295 to 600 g (10.4 to 21.2 oz) and males from 320 to 715 g (11.3 to 25.2 oz). 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The marbled polecat is native from southeastern Europe to [Russia] Russia and [China] China . Its range includes [Ukraine] Ukraine , [Bulgaria] Bulgaria , [Georgia] Georgia , [Turkey] Turkey , [Romania] Romania , [Lebanon] Lebanon , [Syria] Syria , [Jordan] Jordan , [Israel] Israel , [Palestine] Palestine , [Armenia] Armenia , [Azerbaijan] Azerbaijan , [Iraq] Iraq , [Iran] Iran , [Afghanistan] Afghanistan , north-western [Pakistan] Pakistan , [Yugoslavia] Yugoslavia , [Mongolia] Mongolia , China, [Kazakhstan] Kazakhstan , North-Siberian [Altai] Altai  [steppes] steppes . In 1998, a marbled polecat was recorded on the [Sinai Peninsula] Sinai Peninsula , [Egypt] Egypt . Marbled polecats are found in open [desert] desert , semidesert, and [semiarid] semiarid rocky areas in upland [valleys] valleys and low [hill] hill ranges, [steppe] steppe country, and arid subtropical [scrub forest] scrub forest .  They avoid mountainous regions. Marbled polecats have been sighted in cultivated areas such as melon patches and vegetable fields. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The marbled polecat is most active during the morning and evening. Its eyesight is weak, and it relies on its well-developed sense of smell. Vocalization is limited and consists of shrill alarm cries, grunts and a submissive long shriek. It is [solitary] solitary and moves extensively through a [home range] home range of 0.5–0.6 km (0.19–0.23 sq mi). It generally stays in a shelter once. When encountering each other, they are usually aggressive. 
When alarmed, a marbled polecat raises up on its legs while arching its back and curling its tail over its back, with the long tail hair erect. It may also raise its head, bare its teeth, and give shrill, short hisses. If threatened, it can expel a foul-smelling secretion from enlarged anal glands under its tail. 
To excavate burrows, the marbled polecat digs out earth with its forelegs while anchoring itself with its chin and hind legs. It uses its teeth to pull out obstacles such as roots. 
Burrows of large [ground squirrels] ground squirrels or similar rodents such as the [great gerbil] great gerbil ( Rhombomys opimus Rhombomys opimus ) and Libyan [jird] jird ( Meriones libycus Meriones libycus ) are used by marbled polecats for resting and breeding. They may also dig their own dens or live in underground irrigation tunnels. In the winter, marbled polecats line their dens with grass. 
=== Reproduction ===
Marbled polecats mate from March to early June. Their mating calls are most often heard as low, rumbling sounds in a slow rhythm. [Gestation] Gestation can be long and variable (243 to 327 days). [Parturition] Parturition has been observed to occur from late January to mid-March.  [Delayed implantation] Delayed implantation allows marbled polecats to time the birth of their cubs for favorable conditions, such as when prey is abundant. 
Litter sizes range from four to eight cubs. Only females care for the young. Cubs open their eyes  around 38–40 days old, are [weaned] weaned at 50–54 days, and leave their mother (disperse) at 61–68 days old. 
=== Diet ===
Marbled polecats are known to eat [ground squirrels] ground squirrels , [Libyan jirds] Libyan jirds ( Meriones libycus Meriones libycus ), Armenian hamsters ( Cricetulus migratorius [Cricetulus migratorius] Cricetulus migratorius ), [voles] voles , [Palestine mole-rats] Palestine mole-rats ( Spalax lecocon ehrenbergi Spalax lecocon ehrenbergi ), [house mice] house mice ( Mus musculus Mus musculus ), and other rodents, small [hares] hares , [birds] birds , [lizards] lizards , [fish] fish , [frogs] frogs , [snails] snails , and [insects] insects ( [beetles] beetles and [crickets] crickets ), as well as fruit and grass. They are also recorded as taking small domestic poultry such as [chickens] chickens and [pigeons] pigeons , as well as stealing smoked meat and cheese. 
== Conservation status ==
In 2008, the marbled polecat was classified as a [vulnerable species] vulnerable species in the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List due to a population reduction of at least 30% in the previous 10 years. In 1996, it had been considered a species of [least concern] least concern . The decline in marbled polecat populations thought to be due to [habitat loss] habitat loss and reduction in available prey due to use of [rodenticides] rodenticides . 
Data revealed that from the west to the east, a gradual decrease in morphological diversity was seen in polecat skulls, thus giving location as a factor to diversify the polecats. Also, the data related to the range formation of the species rather than [climate change] climate change . 
== Threats ==
The marbled polecat was once sought for its fur, generally known as ""fitch"" or more specifically, ""perwitsky"" in the fur trade.

Patagonian Mara,Patagonian mara,"
The Patagonian mara Patagonian mara ( Dolichotis patagonum Dolichotis patagonum Dolichotis patagonum ) is a relatively large [rodent] rodent in the [mara] mara genus Dolichotis Dolichotis . It is also known as the Patagonian cavy Patagonian cavy or Patagonian hare Patagonian hare . This [herbivorous] herbivorous , somewhat [rabbit] rabbit -like animal is found in open and semiopen habitats in [Argentina] Argentina , including large parts of [Patagonia] Patagonia . A population has also been recorded in the northern [United Arab Emirates] United Arab Emirates , possibly as a result of escaped pets or captive animals. It is [monogamous] monogamous , but often breeds in warrens shared by several pairs.
== Description ==
The Patagonian mara resembles a [jackrabbit] jackrabbit . It has distinctive upright ears and long limbs. Its hind limbs are longer and more muscular than its fore limbs and it has a longer [radius] radius than [humerus] humerus . The feet are compressed, making them hoof-like, which contributes to Patagonian maras resembling small [ungulates] ungulates , especially when standing or walking. The fore feet have four digits while the hind feet have three digits. Its tail is short, depressed, and hairless. It has a gray dorsal pelage with a white patch on the rump separated from the dorsal fur by a black area. In addition, the mara has a white underside with a somewhat orange flank and chin. The average Patagonian mara has a head and body length of 69–75 cm (27–30 in) with a tail of 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in). It weighs 8–16 kg (18–35 lb). Unlike most other [caviids] caviids , such as [guinea pigs] guinea pigs and [capybaras] capybaras , the [anal glands] anal glands of the mara are between the anus and the base of the tail rather than being anterior to the anus. 
== Ecology and activity ==
Patagonian maras are found only in Argentina, from [28] 28 to [50°S] 50°S . They prefer to live in habitats with shrub cover, but they also inhabit overgrazed and barren soils in the [Monte Desert] Monte Desert biome. In northwestern Argentina, they primarily inhabit lowland habitats such as forest and [creosote] creosote bush or larrea [larrea] larrea . Maras prefer sandy and low shrub habitat in [Valdes Peninsula] Valdes Peninsula . They have adapted well to a cursorial lifestyle on the open plains and steppe, with long legs, reduced [clavicle] clavicle , and well-developed sensory organs making them capable of running and communicating in these open habitats. When running, maras have been compared to deer and [antelope] antelope . Maras are largely [herbivorous] herbivorous . They feed primarily on green vegetation and fruit. In the Monte Desert, [monocots] monocots make up 70% of their diet, while [dicots] dicots make up 30%. Preferred grass species eaten are those of the genera Chloris [Chloris] Chloris , Pappophorum [Pappophorum] Pappophorum , and Trichloris [Trichloris] Trichloris , while dicots that are eaten include [Atriplex] Atriplex lampa , Lycium [Lycium] Lycium spp.,  and Prosopis [Prosopis] Prosopis spp. 
Maras are primarily [diurnal] diurnal and around 46% of their daily activities involve feeding. Their temporal activity rhythms are related to environmental factors. Light, precipitation, and temperature have positive effects on annual activities, while darkness and relative humidity have negative effects. The daily activity of maras is [unimodal] unimodal in winter and biomodal in other seasons. Their preferred temperature is around 20 °C or 68 °F. Females spend more time feeding than the males, due to the demands of gestation and lactation. Males spend most of the day sitting and being vigilant for predators. Predators of maras, particularly the young, are [felids] felids , [grisons] grisons , [foxes] foxes , and [birds of prey] birds of prey . Maras are also hosts for parasites such as the [nematode] nematode worm Wellcomia dolichotis [Wellcomia dolichotis] Wellcomia dolichotis . 
== Social behavior and reproduction ==
Their social organizations have a unique combination of monogamy and communal breeding. Being monogamous, pairs of maras stay together for life, with replacement of partners only occurring after one's death. The male has almost the sole responsibility in maintaining the pair by following the female wherever she goes. A male marks his female with urine and marks the ground around her with secretions from his glands and with feces, making the grounds around the female a mobile territory. Pairs breed together alone or with other pairs in [warrens] warrens shared by up to 29 pairs. Maras breed, at least in southern Argentina, from August to January. Gestation lasts 100 days in wild. Most births in Patagonia occur between September and October, which is before the summer dry season and after the winter rains. Females produce one litter each year in the wild, but can produce as many as four litters a year in captivity. Young can walk almost immediately [postpartum] postpartum . 
Dens are dug during the breeding season for the young to be raised. Litters from one to 22 pairs are grouped together in these dens. Communal living provides protection from predators with the survival rate for young being higher in larger groups than in smaller groups. One pair visits the den at a time for around one hour and the other parents  circle around the den. One or two  pups are nursed at a time by a female. A female may sometimes nurse a young from another pair. While a female may prevent young other than her own from nursing her, some young are able to steal milk. Mothers do not actively cooperate in raising their young. For the first three weeks, young remain near the den. At this time, distance between individuals is low, with frequent body contact, huddling, [allogrooming] allogrooming , and extended play among the pups. After this, the young are able to leave the den and graze with their parents. Young are weaned after 13 weeks.
Maras make a number of vocalizations during grazing or slow locomotion. When seeking contact, a mara emits an inflected ""wheet"" while a low, repetitive grunt is made when following a [conspecific] conspecific . Maras tooth chatter and emit low grunts when threatened. They also produce a series of short grunts when grooming. Scent marking is used by maras for complex and intense social interactions. Maras stretch and sniff the soil and then sit upright with an arched back and the anogenital area flattened to the ground, a process known as anal digging. In addition, a male stands on his hind legs and urinates on a female's rump, to which the female responds by [spraying a jet of urine backwards] spraying a jet of urine backwards into the face of the male. The male's urination is meant to repel other males from his partner, while the female's urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not [receptive] receptive . Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males. 
== Status ==
Patagonian maras are considered to be a [near threatened] near threatened species. Historically, maras have ranged from north-central Argentina south almost to [Tierra del Fuego] Tierra del Fuego . Nevertheless, maras have been greatly affected by hunting and habitat alteration and have been [extirpated] extirpated in some areas, including [Buenos Aires Province] Buenos Aires Province . Mara skins have been used for bedspreads and rugs.

Electric Eel,Electric eel,"
The electric eels electric eels are a [genus] genus , Electrophorus Electrophorus Electrophorus , of [neotropical] neotropical  [freshwater fish] freshwater fish from South America in the family [Gymnotidae] Gymnotidae . They are known for their [ability to stun their prey by generating electricity] ability to stun their prey by generating electricity , delivering shocks at up to 860 [volts] volts . Their electrical capabilities were first studied in 1775, contributing to the invention in 1800 of the [electric battery] electric battery .
Despite their name, electric eels are not closely related to the true eels ( [Anguilliformes] Anguilliformes ) but are members of the [electroreceptive] electroreceptive knifefish [order] order , [Gymnotiformes] Gymnotiformes . This order is more closely related to [catfish] catfish . In 2019, electric eels were split into three species: for more than two centuries before that, the genus was believed to be [monotypic] monotypic , containing only [Electrophorus electricus] Electrophorus electricus . 
They are nocturnal, obligate air-breathing animals, with poor vision complemented by [electrolocation] electrolocation ; they mainly eat fish. Electric eels grow for as long as they live, adding more vertebrae to their spinal column. Males are larger than females. Some captive specimens have lived for over 20 years.
== Evolution ==
=== Taxonomy ===
When the species now defined as Electrophorus electricus Electrophorus electricus was described by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in 1766, based on early field research by Europeans in South America and specimens sent back to Europe for study, he used the name Gymnotus electricus Gymnotus electricus , placing it in the same genus as Gymnotus carapo [Gymnotus carapo] Gymnotus carapo (the banded knifefish). He noted that the fish is from the rivers of [Surinam] Surinam , that it causes painful shocks, and that it had small pits around the head. 
In 1864, [Theodore Gill] Theodore Gill moved the electric eel to its own genus, Electrophorus Electrophorus . The name is from the Greek ήλεκτρον ήλεκτρον ήλεκτρον ( ḗlektron ḗlektron ḗlektron ' [amber] amber , a substance able to hold [static electricity] static electricity '), and φέρω φέρω φέρω ( phérō phérō phérō 'I carry'), giving the meaning 'electricity bearer'. In 1872, Gill decided that the electric eel was sufficiently distinct to have its own family, Electrophoridae. In 1998, [Albert] Albert and Campos-da-Paz lumped the Electrophorus Electrophorus genus with the family [Gymnotidae] Gymnotidae , alongside Gymnotus Gymnotus , as did Ferraris and colleagues in 2017. 
In 2019, C. David de Santana and colleagues divided E. electricus E. electricus into three species based on DNA divergence, ecology and habitat, anatomy and physiology, and electrical ability. The three species are E. electricus [E. electricus] E. electricus (now in a narrower sense than before), and the two new species E. voltai [E. voltai] E. voltai and E. varii [E. varii] E. varii . 
=== Phylogeny ===
Electric eels form a [clade] clade of strongly [electric fishes] electric fishes within the order [Gymnotiformes] Gymnotiformes , the South American knifefishes. Electric eels are thus not closely related to the true eels ( [Anguilliformes] Anguilliformes ). The lineage of the Electrophorus Electrophorus genus is estimated to have split from its [sister taxon] sister taxon  Gymnotus [Gymnotus] Gymnotus sometime in the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous . Most knifefishes are weakly electric, capable of active [electrolocation] electrolocation but not of delivering shocks. Their relationships, as shown in the cladogram, were analysed by sequencing their [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA in 2019. Actively electrolocating fish are marked with a small yellow lightning flash [] . Fish able to deliver electric shocks are marked with a red lightning flash [] .

=== Species ===
There are three described species in the genus, not differing significantly in body shape or coloration: 
E. varii E. varii appears to have diverged from the other species around 7.1 mya during the [late Miocene] late Miocene , while E. electricus E. electricus and E. voltai E. voltai may have split around 3.6 mya during the [Pliocene] Pliocene . 
== Ecology ==
The three species have largely non-overlapping distributions in the northern part of South America. E. electricus E. electricus is northern, confined to the [Guiana Shield] Guiana Shield , while E. voltai E. voltai is southern, ranging from the [Brazilian shield] Brazilian shield northwards; both species live in upland waters. E. varii E. varii is central, largely in the lowlands. The lowland region of E. varii E. varii is a variable environment, with habitats ranging from streams through grassland and ravines to ponds, and large changes in water level between the wet and [dry seasons] dry seasons . All live on muddy river bottoms and sometimes swamps, favouring areas in deep shade. They can tolerate water low in oxygen as they swim to the surface to breathe air. 
Electric eels are mostly [nocturnal] nocturnal .  E. voltai E. voltai mainly eats fish, in particular the armoured catfish Megalechis thoracata [Megalechis thoracata] Megalechis thoracata . A specimen of E. voltai E. voltai had a [caecilian] caecilian (a legless amphibian), Typhlonectes compressicauda [Typhlonectes compressicauda] Typhlonectes compressicauda , in its stomach; it is possible that this means that the species is resistant to the caecilian's [toxic] toxic skin secretions.  E. voltai E. voltai sometimes hunts in packs; and have been observed targeting a shoal of [tetras] tetras , then herding them and launching joint strikes on the closely packed fish. The other species, E. varii E. varii , is also a fish [predator] predator ; it preys especially on [Callichthyidae] Callichthyidae (armoured catfishes) and [Cichlidae] Cichlidae (cichlids). 
== Biology ==
=== General biology ===
Electric eels have long, stout bodies, being somewhat cylindrical at the front but more flattened towards the tail end. E. electricus E. electricus can reach 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, and 20 kg (44 lb) in weight. The mouth is at the front of the snout, and [opens upwards] opens upwards . They have smooth, thick, brown-to-black skin with a yellow or red underbelly and no [scales] scales . The pectoral fins each possess eight tiny radial bones at the tip. They have over 100 precaudal vertebrae (excluding the tail), whereas other gymnotids have up to 51 of these; there can be as many as 300 vertebrae in total. There is no clear boundary between the tail fin and the [anal fin] anal fin , which extends much of the length of the body on the underside and has over 400 bony [rays] rays . Electric eels rely on the wave-like movements of their elongated anal fin to [propel] propel themselves through the water. 
Electric eels get most of their oxygen by breathing air using [buccal pumping] buccal pumping . This enables them to live in habitats with widely varying oxygen levels including streams, swamps, and pools. Uniquely among the gymnotids, the [buccal cavity] buccal cavity is lined with a frilled [mucosa] mucosa which has a rich blood supply, enabling [gas exchange] gas exchange between the air and the blood. About every two minutes, the fish takes in air through the mouth, holds it in the buccal cavity, and expels it through the [opercular openings] opercular openings at the sides of the head. Unlike in other air-breathing fish, the tiny gills of electric eels do not ventilate when taking in air. The majority of [carbon dioxide] carbon dioxide produced is expelled through the skin. These fish can survive on land for some hours if their skin is wet enough. 
Electric eels have small eyes and poor vision. They are capable of hearing via a [Weberian apparatus] Weberian apparatus , which consists of tiny bones connecting the inner ear to the [swim bladder] swim bladder . All of the vital organs are packed in near the front of the animal, taking up only 20% of space and sequestered from the electric organs. 
=== Electrophysiology ===
Electric eels can locate their prey using [electroreceptors] electroreceptors derived from the [lateral line organ] lateral line organ in the head. The lateral line itself is [mechanosensory] mechanosensory , enabling them to sense water movements created by animals nearby. The lateral line canals are beneath the skin, but their position is visible as lines of pits on the head. Electric eels use their high frequency-sensitive [tuberous receptors] tuberous receptors , distributed in patches over the body, for hunting other knifefish. 
Electric eels have three pairs of [electric organs] electric organs , arranged longitudinally: the main organ, Hunter's organ, and Sachs' organ. These organs give electric eels the ability to generate two types of [electric organ discharges] electric organ discharges : low voltage and high voltage. The organs are made of [electrocytes] electrocytes , modified from [muscle cells] muscle cells . Like muscle cells, the electric eel's electrocytes contain the proteins [actin] actin and [desmin] desmin , but where muscle cell proteins form a dense structure of parallel [fibrils] fibrils , in electrocytes they form a loose network. Five different forms of desmin occur in electrocytes, compared to two or three in muscle, but its function in electrocytes remained unknown as of 2017. 
Potassium channel [proteins] proteins involved in electric organ discharge, including [KCNA1] KCNA1 , [KCNH6] KCNH6 , and [KCNJ12] KCNJ12 , are distributed differently among the three electric organs: most such proteins are most abundant in the main organ and least abundant in Sachs's organ, but KCNH6 is most abundant in Sachs's organ. The main organ and Hunter's organ are rich in the protein [calmodulin] calmodulin , involved in controlling calcium ion levels. Calmodulin and calcium help to regulate the [voltage-gated sodium channels] voltage-gated sodium channels that create the electrical discharge. These organs are also rich in [sodium potassium ATPase] sodium potassium ATPase , an [ion pump] ion pump used to create a potential difference across cell membranes. 
The maximum discharge from the main organ is at least 600 [volts] volts , making electric eels the most powerful of all electric fishes. Freshwater fishes like the electric eel require a high voltage to give a strong shock because freshwater has [high resistance] high resistance ; powerful marine electric fishes like the [torpedo ray] torpedo ray give a shock at much lower voltage but a far higher current. The electric eel produces its strong discharge extremely rapidly, at a rate of as much as 500 [Hertz] Hertz , meaning that each shock lasts only about two milliseconds. To generate a high voltage, an electric eel stacks some 6,000 electrocytes in series (longitudinally) in its main organ; the organ contains some 35 such stacks in parallel, on each side of the body. The ability to produce high-voltage, high-frequency pulses in addition enables the electric eel to electrolocate rapidly moving prey. The total electric current delivered during each pulse can reach about 1 [ampere] ampere . 
It remains unclear why electric eels have three electric organs but basically produce two types of discharge, to electrolocate or to stun. In 2021, Jun Xu and colleagues stated that Hunter's organ produces a third type of discharge at a middle voltage of 38.5 to 56.5 volts. Their measurements indicate that this is produced just once, for less than 2 milliseconds, after the low-voltage discharge of Sachs's organ and before the high-voltage discharge of the main organ. They believed that this is insufficient to stimulate a response from the prey, so they suggested it may have the function of co-ordination within the electric eel's body, perhaps by balancing the electrical charge, but state that more research is needed. 
When an electric eel identifies prey, its brain sends a nerve signal to the electric organ; the nerve cells involved release the [neurotransmitter] neurotransmitter chemical [acetylcholine] acetylcholine to trigger an electric organ discharge. This opens [ion channels] ion channels , allowing [sodium] sodium to flow into the electrocytes, reversing the polarity momentarily. The discharge is terminated by an outflow of [potassium] potassium ions through a separate set of ion channels. By causing a sudden difference in [electric potential] electric potential , it generates an [electric current] electric current in a manner similar to a [battery] battery , in which cells are stacked to produce a desired total voltage output. It has been suggested that Sachs' organ is used for electrolocation; its discharge is of nearly 10 volts at a frequency of around 25 Hz. The main organ, supported by Hunter's organ in some way, is used to stun prey or to deter predators; it can emit signals at rates of several hundred hertz. Electric eels can concentrate the discharge to stun prey more effectively by curling up and making contact with the prey at two points along the body. It has also been suggested that electric eels can control their prey's nervous systems and muscles via electrical pulses, keeping prey from escaping, or forcing it to move so they can locate it, but this has been disputed. In [self-defence] self-defence , electric eels have been observed to leap from the water to deliver electric shocks to animals that might pose a threat. The shocks from leaping electric eels are powerful enough to drive away animals as large as horses. 
== Life cycle ==
Electric eels reproduce during the dry season, from September to December. During this time, male-female pairs are seen in small pools left behind after water levels drop. The male makes a nest using his saliva and the female deposits around 1,200 eggs for [fertilisation] fertilisation . Spawn hatch seven days later and mothers keep depositing eggs periodically throughout the breeding season, making them fractional spawners. When they reach 15 mm (0.59 in), the hatched larvae consume any leftover eggs, and after they reach 9 cm (3.5 in) they begin to eat other foods. Electric eels are [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic , males becoming reproductively active at 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) in length and growing larger than females; females start to reproduce at a body length of around 70 cm (2 ft 4 in). The adults provide prolonged parental care lasting four months. E. electricus E. electricus and E. voltai E. voltai , the two upland species which live in fast-flowing rivers, appear to make less use of parental care. The male provides protection for both the young and the nest. Captive specimens have sometimes lived for over 20 years. 
As the fish grow, they continually add more vertebrae to their spinal column. The main organ is the first electric organ to develop, followed by Sachs' organ and then Hunter's organ. All the electric organs are differentiated by the time the body reaches a length of 23 cm (9.1 in). Electric eels are able to produce electrical discharges when they are as small as 7 cm (2.8 in). 
== Interactions with humans ==
=== Early research ===
The first written mention of the electric eel or puraké puraké puraké ('the one that numbs' in [Tupi] Tupi ) is in records by the [Jesuit] Jesuit priest Fernão Cardim in 1583. The naturalists Bertrand Bajon, a French military surgeon in [French Guiana] French Guiana , and the Jesuit [Ramón M. Termeyer] Ramón M. Termeyer [ [pl] pl ] in the [River Plate basin] River Plate basin , conducted early experiments on the numbing discharges of electric eels in the 1760s. In 1775, the ""torpedo"" (the electric ray) was studied by [John Walsh] John Walsh ; both fish were dissected by the surgeon and anatomist [John Hunter] John Hunter . Hunter informed the [Royal Society] Royal Society that ""Gymnotus Electricus   [...] appears very much like an eel   [...] but it has none of the specific properties of that fish."" He observed that there were ""two pair of these [electric] organs, a larger [the main organ] and a smaller [Hunter's organ]; one being placed on each side"", and that they occupied ""perhaps   [...] more than one-third of the whole animal [by volume]"". He described the structure of the organs (stacks of electrocytes) as ""extremely simple and regular, consisting of two parts; viz. viz. flat partitions or septa septa , and cross divisions between them."" He measured the electrocytes as .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 1 1 ⁄ 17 17 inch (1.5 mm) thick in the main organ, and 1 1 ⁄ 56 56 inch (0.45 mm) thick in Hunter's organ. 
Also in 1775, the American physician and politician [Hugh Williamson] Hugh Williamson , who had studied with Hunter, presented a paper ""Experiments and observations on the Gymnotus Electricus, or electric eel"" at the Royal Society. He reported a series of experiments, such as ""7. In order to discover whether the eel killed those fish by an emission of the same [electrical] fluid with which he affected my hand when I had touched him, I put my hand into the water, at some distance from the eel; another cat-fish was thrown into the water; the eel swam up to it ... [and] gave it a shock, by which it instantly turned up its belly, and continued motionless; at that very instant I felt such a sensation in the joints of my fingers as in experiment 4."" and ""12. Instead of putting my hand into the water, at a distance from the eel, as in the last experiment, I touched its tail, so as not to offend it, while my assistant touched its head more roughly; we both received a severe shock."" 
The studies by Williamson, Walsh, and Hunter appear to have influenced the thinking of [Luigi Galvani] Luigi Galvani and [Alessandro Volta] Alessandro Volta . Galvani founded [electrophysiology] electrophysiology , with research into how electricity makes a frog's leg twitch; Volta began [electrochemistry] electrochemistry , with his invention of the [electric battery] electric battery . 
In 1800, the explorer [Alexander von Humboldt] Alexander von Humboldt joined a group of indigenous people who went fishing with horses, some thirty of which they chased into the water. The pounding of the horses' hooves, he noted, drove the fish, up to 5 feet (1.5 m) long out of the mud and prompted them to attack, rising out of the water and using their electricity to shock the horses. He saw two horses stunned by the shocks and then drowned. The electric eels, having given many shocks, ""now require long rest and plenty of nourishment to replace the loss of galvanic power they have suffered"", ""swam timidly to the bank of the pond"", and were easily caught using small [harpoons] harpoons on ropes. Humboldt recorded that the people did not eat the electric organs, and that they feared the fish so much that they would not fish for them in the usual way. 
In 1839, the chemist [Michael Faraday] Michael Faraday extensively tested the electrical properties of an electric eel imported from Surinam. For a span of four months, he measured the electrical impulses produced by the animal by pressing shaped copper paddles and saddles against the specimen. Through this method, he determined and quantified the direction and magnitude of electric current, and proved that the animal's impulses were electrical by observing sparks and deflections on a [galvanometer] galvanometer . He observed the electric eel increasing the shock by coiling about its prey, the prey fish ""representing a diameter"" across the coil. He likened the quantity of [electric charge] electric charge released by the fish to ""the electricity of a [Leyden battery] Leyden battery of fifteen jars, containing 23,000 cm (3,500 sq in) of glass coated on both sides, charged to its highest degree"". 
The German zoologist [Carl Sachs] Carl Sachs was sent to Latin America by the physiologist [Emil du Bois-Reymond] Emil du Bois-Reymond , to study the electric eel; he took with him a galvanometer and electrodes to measure the fish's electric organ discharge, and used rubber gloves to enable him to catch the fish without being shocked, to the surprise of the local people. He published his research on the fish, including his discovery of what is now called Sachs' organ, in 1877. 
=== Artificial electrocytes ===
The large quantity of electrocytes available in the electric eel enabled biologists to study the voltage-gated sodium channel in molecular detail. The channel is an important mechanism, as it serves to trigger muscle contraction in many species, but it is hard to study in muscle as it is found in extremely small amounts. In 2008, Jian Xu and David Lavan designed artificial cells that would be able to replicate the electrical behaviour of electric eel electrocytes. The artificial electrocytes would use a calculated selection of [conductors] conductors at [nanoscopic scale] nanoscopic scale . Such cells would use ion transport as electrocytes do, with a greater output [power density] power density , and [converting energy more efficiently] converting energy more efficiently . They suggest that such artificial electrocytes could be developed as a power source for [medical implants] medical implants such as [retinal prostheses] retinal prostheses and other microscopic devices. They comment that the work ""has mapped out changes in the system level design of the electrocyte"" that could increase both energy density and energy conversion efficiency. In 2009, they made synthetic [protocells] protocells which can provide about a twentieth of the energy density of a [lead–acid battery] lead–acid battery , and an energy conversion efficiency of 10%. 
In 2016, Hao Sun and colleagues described a family of electric eel-mimicking devices that serve as high output voltage electrochemical [capacitors] capacitors . These are fabricated as flexible fibres that can be woven into textiles. Sun and colleagues suggest that the storage devices could serve as power sources for products such as [electric watches] electric watches or [light-emitting diodes] light-emitting diodes .

Galápagos Penguin,Galapagos penguin,"
The Galápagos penguin Galápagos penguin ( Spheniscus mendiculus Spheniscus mendiculus Spheniscus mendiculus ) is a [penguin] penguin  [endemic] endemic to the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands of [Ecuador] Ecuador . It is the only penguin found north of the [equator] equator . Most inhabit [Fernandina Island] Fernandina Island and the west coast of [Isabela Island] Isabela Island . The cool waters of the [Humboldt] Humboldt and [Cromwell Currents] Cromwell Currents allow it to survive despite the tropical latitude. The Galápagos penguin is one of the [banded penguins] banded penguins , the other species of which live mostly on the coasts of [Africa] Africa and mainland [South America] South America . Due to their warm environment, Galápagos penguins have developed techniques to stay cool. The feathers on their back, flippers, and head are black, and they have a white belly and a stripe looping from their eyes down to their neck and chin. Each penguin keeps only one mate, and breeds year-round. Because there is no soft areas to nest, their nests are typically in caves and crevices which also provide protection against predators and the harsh environment. The Galápagos penguin has a lifespan of 20 years, but due to [predation] predation , life expectancy in the wild could be significantly reduced. They have been critically impacted to the point of endangerment by [climate change] climate change and pollution caused by [plastic waste] plastic waste due to tourism and [urbanization] urbanization . 
== Description ==
The average Galápagos penguin is 48–50 centimetres (19–20 in) tall and weighs around 2–4 kilograms (4.4–8.8 lb). It is the second-smallest species of penguin, after the [little penguin] little penguin . Females are usually smaller than males. Galápagos penguins have a black head with a white border running from behind the eye, around the black ear coverts and chin, to join on the throat. The top of the beaks are black and fade into pink on the bottom. They have two black bands across the breast that connect to the back, the lower band extending down the flanks to the thigh. Juveniles differ in having a wholly dark head, grayer on side and chin, and no breast band. 
== History ==
Many years ago, the [Humboldt Current] Humboldt Current is believed to have brought the penguins from mainland [South America] South America to the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands , where they have evolved in isolation into a separate species. Islands such as [Isabela Island] Isabela Island contained cold and nutrient-rich waters that provided abundant food, ensuring the survival and reproduction of penguins. Over millions of years, the penguins underwent adaptations, developing unique features that enabled their existence and allowed them to thrive under such an ecological niche. Today, the Galápagos penguins are among the smallest penguin species. 
== Distribution ==
Ninety percent of Galápagos penguins live on [Fernandina Island] Fernandina Island and the west coast of [Isabela Island] Isabela Island , in the western part of the archipelago, but small populations also occur on [Santiago] Santiago , [Bartolomé] Bartolomé , northern [Santa Cruz] Santa Cruz , and [Floreana] Floreana . The northern tip of Isabela crosses the equator, meaning that some Galápagos penguins live in the [Northern Hemisphere] Northern Hemisphere , the only penguins to do so.
== Behavior ==
Galápagos penguins are confined to the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands , foraging in the cool [Cromwell Current] Cromwell Current during the day and returning to the land at night. They eat small schooling fish, mainly mullet, sardines, pilchards and anchovies, and sometimes [crustaceans] crustaceans .They play a role in regulating the populations of the marine species they consume. At the same time, the adult Galápagos penguins are a food source for other predators such as sharks and whales. They normally range only a few kilometers from their breeding sites, depending on the cold, nutrient-rich currents to bring them food.
Air temperatures in the Galápagos remain in the range 15–28 °C (59–82 °F). During [El Niño] El Niño seasons, the penguins defer breeding because their food becomes less abundant; this makes the chances of raising offspring successfully unfavorable compared to the chances of dying in the attempt. This was especially detrimental during the [1982-83 El Niño] 1982-83 El Niño , where a decline in population of 77% was observed. The penguins usually breed when the [sea surface temperature] sea surface temperature is below 25 °C (77 °F). The strong tropical sun is problematic for this species. Their primary means of cooling off is going in the water, but other behavioral adaptations for [thermoregulation] thermoregulation come into play when they must remain on land. One method involves stretching out their flippers and hunching forward to keep the sun from shining on their feet, which exchange heat rapidly because they have high blood flow and lack insulation. Another method is to pant, using evaporation to cool the throat and airways. Galápagos penguins protect their eggs and chicks from the hot sun by keeping them in deep crevices in the rocks.
The Galápagos penguins' flipper-like wings and streamlined bodies enhance their easy movements in water. Their white and black colors also aid in thermal regulation and camouflaging. All these features promote and ensure survival in the harsh conditions present in their coastal habitat, hence the symbiotic relationship between the Galápagos penguins and their natural environment. The penguins' breeding patterns depend on finding suitable nesting places within the volcanic landscape. The Galápagos penguins find refuge in the cool and dark lava caves, which provide the appropriate conditions for raising their offspring since they offer protection from the sun, ensuring survival. This indicates specific behavioral patterns and features that enhance their adaptability in this particular environment.
=== Breeding and reproduction ===
Galápagos penguins are a [monogamous] monogamous species, each pair mating for life. There are around 1,000 breeding pairs of Galápagos penguins in the world, and breeding depends on certain climate events. During El Niño, birds may not breed due to these climate conditions. After completing courtship, with rituals including bill dueling, flipper patting, and mutual preening, the pair will build and maintain a nest. Most nests are seen between May and July because both quantity of food and climate conditions are typically most optimal. The nests are made within 50 metres (160 ft) of the water on the shore. Adults stay near the breeding area during the year with their mate. It lays one or two eggs in places such as caves and crevices, protected from direct sunlight, which can cause the eggs to overheat. Temperature of surface water also influences reproduction as they prefer temperatures between 17 and 22 °C (63 and 72 °F) to incubate, above 25 °C (77 °F) causes their nests to fail.  [Incubation] Incubation takes 38–40 days, with both parents incubating. 
One parent will always stay with the eggs or young chicks while the other may be absent for several days to feed. A pair usually rears only one chick. Galápagos penguins will [molt] molt before they breed, and are the only penguins to do this twice a year. Molting takes up to 15 days to complete. They do this for their own safety, as food availability in the Galápagos is typically unpredictable. If there is not enough food available, they may abandon the nest.
It takes about 60–65 days for the chicks to become independent. Newly hatched chicks have downy feathers that do not become waterproof until the chicks grow into juveniles. The juvenile plumage, attained by thirty days after a chick hatches, is dark brown or gray above and white below. These feathers are mainly needed to protect the chicks from the strong sun rather than keep them warm.
Bermudian naturalist [Louis L. Mowbray] Louis L. Mowbray was the first to successfully breed the Galápagos penguins in captivity. 
=== Population ===
Galápagos penguins have a lifespan ranging from 15 to 20 years, but because of environmental factors and predation, their life expectancy is reduced. They are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Endangered. Their mean population size from the years 1993-2003 was an average of 1,500. In 2003 there were an estimated 1,351 penguins and as of 2018 there are around 1,200 mature penguins left. The Galapagos penguin is currently one of the rarest penguin species, next to another penguin species, the [yellow-eyed penguin] yellow-eyed penguin .
The population size on average is about 1,500 individuals per year, depending on the climate events. Population trends were seen to increase and decrease in a span of a year due to [La Niña] La Niña and [El Niño] El Niño events, weather events that affect the conditions on the Galápagos Islands. After a La Niña event, both population size and reproduction were both seen to have an increase in number. El Niño events have been found to reduce Galápagos penguin populations, in some cases nearly as much as 50% decrease was seen in population size. This is due to the warmer climate disrupting the cold water that holds the nutrients that support the marine ecosystem. 
== Conservation ==
=== El Niño and climate change ===
The Galápagos penguin is a particularly vulnerable bird species due to its limited range on the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands . With a population of only about 1800, it remains on the endangered species list, and its population will likely fluctuate strongly in response to [anthropogenic] anthropogenic changes in the region. The primary danger to the Galápagos penguin is the climate phenomena known as [El Niño] El Niño . In 1982-83 and 1997–98, two strong El Niño events resulted in Galápagos penguin population declines of 77% and 65%, respectively. Additionally, the years 1965–66, 1968–69, 1972–73, 1976, 1986–87, 1991–92 and 1993 all had relatively weak El Niño events which were associated with slow population recovery. Conversely, during [La Niña] La Niña events when sea surface temperatures are lower than normal and the climate patterns shift, Galápagos penguin populations begin to recover.  [Anthropogenic climate change] Anthropogenic climate change has been shown to increase frequency and intensity of El Niño events beyond levels of natural variability which negatively impacts the Galápagos penguin. Warmer temperatures caused by El Niño are associated with poorer female condition and lower adult body weights. Body conditions fluctuate along with the climate events, evidence showing that weight is enhanced during La Nina's cooler temperatures but body weight deteriorates during El Nino when surface level waters are warmed. Under severe conditions, the penguins can even suffer from starvation. This is due to the warmer temperatures of El Niño events resulting in a decrease in [upwelling] upwelling of the cold nutrient rich waters which decreases [phytoplankton] phytoplankton productivity and results in bottom up [trophic] trophic disruptions that reduce the food availability for the Galápagos penguin. This lack of food leads to poor breeding success and a disproportionate female death rate, causing population decline and disrupting future recovery by creating uneven sex ratios in the populations. Predictive models suggest future El Niño events will increase in frequency and severity over the next century, posing further threats to the Galápagos penguin. If the pattern of El Niño events from 1965 to 2004 continues, there is a 30% chance of extinction for the Galápagos penguin. If the frequency of strong El Niño events were to double over this same time period, the chance of extinction would be 80%. 
=== Urbanization ===
[Urban environments] Urban environments , although physically distant from the remote habitat of the Galápagos penguins, exert an indirect influence on the Galápagos Penguins. The connection lies in the extensive web of human activities contributing to global environmental changes, specifically [climate change] climate change . Despite living in the isolated, unspoiled environments of the islands, Galápagos penguins are nevertheless impacted by the far-reaching effects of urbanization. The intricate relationship between urban environments and penguin populations is exemplified by the pollution that results from human activities, such as the improper disposal of waste into oceans, the emission of [greenhouse gases] greenhouse gases , and excessive energy consumption.
The garbage disposal practices associated with urbanization have a negative impact on marine ecosystems and indirectly affect the Galápagos penguins. The release of plastic, chemicals, and other pollutants into the ocean disrupts [ecosystems] ecosystems and food chains, posing a severe threat to [marine life] marine life . Penguins at higher [trophic levels] trophic levels are vulnerable to the [bioaccumulation] bioaccumulation of pollutants through their prey, leading to adverse health effects and population decline. The water surrounding the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands , known for its biodiversity and pristine nature, becomes a receptacle for urban waste, impacting the penguins and their habitat.
Moreover, burning [fossil fuels] fossil fuels and industrial activities are the main ways urbanization raises greenhouse gas emissions. Due to their heightened sensitivity to environmental changes, Galápagos penguins suffer greatly due to the ensuing climate change. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns may affect their prey's availability, disrupting their feeding and breeding habits. As these penguins rely on a steady balance of environmental factors for their survival, any disturbance brought about by urban-induced climate change can have severe consequences on their population dynamics.
Energy usage, another facet of urbanization, contributes to the depletion of natural resources and the emission of pollutants. The energy demands of urban environments drive resource extraction and exploitation, indirectly affecting the habitats of Galápagos penguins. The association of global ecosystems means that even seemingly isolated regions, such as the Galápagos Islands, are not insulated from the consequences of urban-driven resource depletion. As the energy demand continues to rise globally, the indirect impacts on the Galápagos penguins become more pronounced, underscoring the urgency of adopting sustainable practices.
=== Disease ===
Another potential threat to the Galápagos penguin is disease. Preliminary studies, such as one conducted in 2001, found no evidence of [Avian malaria] Avian malaria or [Marek's disease] Marek's disease in Galápagos penguin populations. Despite these findings, the researchers recommended further observations, citing the death of 800 chickens in the Galápagos Islands from Marek's disease, the presence of mosquitos known to carry Avian malaria, and the known impacts of these diseases on other endemic bird populations in [Hawaii] Hawaii . Later, a 2009 study revealed the presence of a species of Plasmodium [Plasmodium] Plasmodium in Galápagos penguins, a genus of blood parasite that causes Avian malaria. The presence of this parasite suggests that diseases are able to travel from other populations to the isolated Galápagos penguin communities and is likely a cause for population decline. Further research suggests that cross-species transmission may occur between [endemic] endemic Galápagos species and migratory birds such as the [Bobolink] Bobolink . Understanding how these diseases reach the Galápagos Islands and transmit between its bird species is a focus for developing conservation strategies for endangered species such as the Galápagos penguin.
=== Endangerment and Conservation Status ===
The Galápagos penguins face threats to their survival, primarily from anthropogenic climate change, and have been listed as endangered species in 2010 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Anthropogenic climate change manifests in various forms that directly affect the Galápagos penguins. One of the most palpable impacts is the alteration of sea temperatures. Galápagos penguins are adapted to the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Humboldt and [Cromwell currents] Cromwell currents . However, as global temperatures rise, these currents may shift, impacting prey availability and the penguins' ability to forage successfully. Because of this, less food is available, which lowers the penguins' chances of procreating and results in malnutrition.
Another consequence of climate change is the direct threat that sea level fluctuations pose to the nesting sites of the Galápagos penguins. Rising sea levels, attributed to the melting of [polar ice caps] polar ice caps , can inundate low-lying areas where the penguins breed. The loss of nesting sites exacerbates the challenges faced by the species, reducing their reproductive success and hindering population recovery. Due to human activity, invasive species have been introduced into the Galápagos penguins' habitat, posing environmental challenges. People often unknowingly introduce these invaders to the islands, where they compete with penguins for resources and eat their eggs and young. The combination of invasive species and climate change presents a serious threat to their survival. 
Other threats include humans harvesting penguins for oil and other products, competition with fisheries for krill and other fish, habitat loss, increased predation from invasive species, [bycatch] bycatch , and pollution. On [Isabela Island] Isabela Island , humans may be contributing to the decline of this species due to introduced cats, dogs, and rats which attack penguins, destroy nests, and spread disease. Other threats on land include crabs, snakes, [rice rats] rice rats , [Galápagos hawks] Galápagos hawks , and [short-eared owls] short-eared owls . While in the water, predators include sharks, fur seals, and sea lions. They also face the hazards of unreliable food resources and volcanic activity. [Illegal fishing] Illegal fishing activity may interrupt the penguins' nesting, and they are often caught as bycatch in fishing nets.
These impacts are particularly threatening because of the population structure of the Galápagos penguin. The Galápagos penguin consists of two geographic subpopulations, but studies suggest that there is sufficient [gene flow] gene flow between these populations to treat them together when considering conservation strategies. [Reference needed] Additionally, the Galápagos penguin demonstrates relatively low [genetic diversity] genetic diversity , making it especially vulnerable to disease, predation, and other environmental changes. 
The Galápagos penguins are protected under the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which includes all 18 penguin species. Galápagos Penguins live in the Galápagos Islands and they are protected under Ecuadorian jurisdiction. The Directorate of the Galápagos National Park and the Galápagos Marine Reserve are two important factors that are responsible for protecting the islands various species including the Galápagos Penguins. They were able to accomplish this through limiting human activity and interference from outside factors such as fishing and introducing new species to the island.
=== Tourism ===
Tourism is a prominent practice that occurs in the Galápagos and brings in millions of dollars each year in revenue for the islands. Due to the fact that the Galápagos penguins are only found on these islands, birdwatching and ecological tourism targeting penguins are common practices on the Galápagos, and tutorials showing how to find the penguins are readily available. As ecological tourism becomes more common on the Galápagos, it is having a more significant impact on native wildlife, including the Galápagos penguins. When incorrectly executed and poorly managed, tourism can contribute to reproductive failure, burrow collapse, or even death to these animals. 
== Ecology ==
The Galápagos penguin are unique to the Galápagos Islands, predominantly inhabiting Fernandina Island and Isabela Island. These islands offer an environment crucial for these birds' survival and proliferation.
=== Habitat and interaction with the environment ===
The Galápagos penguins have a symbiotic relationship with their habitat. Fernandina and Isabela Islands provide rocky coastlines ideal for nesting, and the surrounding waters, enriched by the Cromwell Current, abound with fish and crustaceans that form their diet. This feeding habit plays a pivotal role in the local marine ecosystem. They help balance the marine food web and contribute to [nutrient cycling] nutrient cycling . The [guano] guano produced by these penguins is a rich fertilizer, enhancing the fertility of the coastal soil and indirectly supporting certain plant species native to the islands. 
=== Adaptation to island Conditions ===
Adapting to the equatorial climate of the Galápagos, these penguins exhibit unique behavioral and physiological traits. Unlike their Antarctic counterparts, they have evolved to withstand warmer temperatures. They pant and seek shade during the hottest parts of the day to regulate body temperature. Physiologically, they have a reduced layer of body fat and smaller size, aiding heat dissipation. 
Galápagos penguins breed throughout the year, capitalizing on the fluctuating availability of food resources linked to ocean currents. This flexibility in breeding patterns is a critical adaptation for survival in an environment where food availability is inconsistent.
=== Impact of environmental factors on life expectancy and population ===
Environmental conditions significantly influence the life expectancy and population numbers of Galápagos penguins. Climate events like El Niño significantly affect the marine ecosystem, reducing food availability. During such events, penguin populations face starvation, reduced breeding success, and increased mortality. [Reference needed] Furthermore, human-induced factors such as pollution, oil spills, and fishing activities pose additional threats to their survival.
Conservation efforts are crucial for protecting these penguins, which are classified as endangered by the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List . Measures include monitoring population trends, habitat preservation, and mitigating human impacts. These efforts are essential to ensure the survival of the Galápagos penguin, a species integral to the biodiversity and ecological balance of the Galápagos Islands.

Proboscis Bat,Proboscis bat,"
The proboscis bat proboscis bat ( Rhynchonycteris naso Rhynchonycteris naso Rhynchonycteris naso ) is a species of [bat] bat found in South America and Central America. Other common names include long-nosed proboscis bat long-nosed proboscis bat , sharp-nosed bat sharp-nosed bat ,  Brazilian long-nosed bat Brazilian long-nosed bat . and river bat river bat . It is the [only species] only species in the genus Rhynchonycteris Rhynchonycteris Rhynchonycteris .
This species is in the family [Emballonuridae] Emballonuridae , the sac-winged or sheath-tailed bats. Like most bats, it is nocturnal. It is found from southern Mexico to Belize, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia and Brazil, as well as in [Trinidad] Trinidad . 
== Characteristics ==
This is a small bat, around 6 centimetres (2.4 inches) long and 4 grams (0.14 ounces) in weight. Males in northern South America were found to average 56 millimetres (2.2 in) long, females 59 millimetres (2.3 in). The tail is about 16 millimetres (0.63 in) long. Pregnant females can weigh up to 6 grams (0.21 oz). 
== Habitat ==
This species is found in the lowlands of the northern half of South America, throughout Central America, and into southeastern Mexico. From Ecuador south, it is limited to east of the Andes; its range extends south to the northern half of Bolivia and much of Brazil. It seldom occurs above 300 meters (980 feet) in elevation. It usually lives around wetlands and is frequently found in riparian forests, pastures swamps, and all near water.
== Habits ==
Proboscis bats live in groups. The colonies are usually between five and ten individuals, and very rarely exceed forty. The bats are nocturnal, sleeping during the day in an unusual formation: most of them line up, one after another, on a branch or wooden beam, nose to tail, in a straight row.
A colony of proboscis bats usually has a regular feeding area, typically a small patch of water. Here the bats catch insects (in the form of [midges] midges [including [chironomids] chironomids ], [mosquitoes] mosquitoes , [beetles] beetles , and [caddisflies] caddisflies ) using echolocation. They have no specific breeding season, forming stable year-round harems. One young is born per female. Both sexes disperse after weaning at around 2–4 months.
This small species of bat has been found to occasionally fall prey to the large spider Argiope savignyi [Argiope savignyi] Argiope savignyi .

Yeti Crab,Kiwa(crustacean),"
Kiwa Kiwa Kiwa is a [genus] genus of marine [decapods] decapods living at deep-sea [hydrothermal vents] hydrothermal vents and [cold seeps] cold seeps . The animals are commonly referred to as ""yeti lobsters"" or ""yeti crabs”, after the legendary [yeti] yeti , because of their ""hairy"" or bristly appearance. The genus is placed in its own family, Kiwaidae Kiwaidae , in the superfamily [Chirostyloidea] Chirostyloidea . The genus Kiwa Kiwa is named after the god of shellfish in Polynesian mythology. 
Based on the presence of [sulphur-oxidising] sulphur-oxidising bacteria on the [setae] setae of both K. hirsuta K. hirsuta and the new South West Indian Ridge species, they may both feed on bacteria in addition to scavenging. For K. puravida K. puravida , the bacteria have been identified and the feeding behaviour observed, as well as a cyclical rhythmic motion of the crab documented that is suspected to increase the flow of methane and [hydrogen sulfide] hydrogen sulfide , the bacterial food, towards the bacteria. The two sexes of the new South West Indian Ridge species prefer different temperatures, with males seeming to prefer warmer water and egg-carrying females and juveniles preferring the coldest. Chemosynthetic bacteria is growing which is affecting the habitat for yeti crabs.
Because yeti crabs live in extreme environments like cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, the species has adapted certain behaviors and qualities to aid their survival. These adaptations include the crab's growth of their setae, propodus and claws. The internal anatomy, diet, behaviors and adaptations of the yeti crab are outlined below.
== Range and habitat ==
Various species of yeti crabs have been found at varying locations. Four species have been described: Kiwa hirsuta [Kiwa hirsuta] Kiwa hirsuta discovered in 2005 on the [Pacific-Antarctic Ridge] Pacific-Antarctic Ridge ,  Kiwa puravida [Kiwa puravida] Kiwa puravida discovered in 2006 at cold seeps in the East Pacific (all other species are from hydrothermal vents),  Kiwa tyleri [Kiwa tyleri] Kiwa tyleri , known colloquially as the ""Hoff crab"", from the [East Scotia Ridge] East Scotia Ridge , and Kiwa araonae [Kiwa araonae] Kiwa araonae from the Australian-Antarctic Ridge. Two similar but [undescribed species] undescribed species are known from vents on the [South West Indian Ridge] South West Indian Ridge and at the [Galápagos] Galápagos respectively. Analysis of DNA has confirmed the distinction of the species, them having diverged from each other millions of years ago. The third undescribed species of Kiwa Kiwa was discovered in 2010 in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean at vents on the East Scotia Ridge. Compared with the first two species, it has proportionally much shorter chelae, with the majority of the bacteria-growing setae concentrated on the ventral carapace. 
Kiwa araonae's discovery added about 6,500 kilometers to the Kiwaidae's known range on mid-ocean ridges. From morphological observations and molecular phylogenetic investigations, K. araonae and K. puravida are closely related.  Although K. araonae K. araonae and K. puravida K. puravida are separated by around 12,000 kilometers, they are similar. Research pertaining to fossils around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary in the eastern Pacific suggests a decrease in deep temperatures and increased ventilation in each habitat may have influenced species divergence. Likewise fossils found in the mid-Miocene (located in the tropical East Pacific), indicate that the evolution of one species of yeti crab, K. puravida, may coincide with lower deep sea temperatures. 
== Diet ==
Kiwa crustaceans play a crucial role in the deep-sea ecosystem, serving as primary consumers and contributing to the biodiversity within hydrothermal vent communities. The absence of sunlight at hydrothermal vents poses a challenge to how vent species obtain energy required to sustain life. Since sunlight cannot provide the necessary fatty acids and carbon isotopes necessary for their survival, yeti crabs rely solely on symbiotic bacteria as their main food source. Yeti crabs feed on chemosynthetic bacteria that reside on hair-like setae on the outer appendages of the crustacean. Other organisms, such as Shinkaia crosnieri [Shinkaia crosnieri] Shinkaia crosnieri and Rimicaris exoculata Rimicaris exoculata exhibit similar dietary patterns as the yeti crab.
== Behaviors ==
=== Feeding behavior ===
Scientists have observed that K. puravida K. puravida have a unique approach when it comes to farming food. This method has made the species become known as the ""dancing crab"". Yeti crabs have been observed waving their claws around near cold seeps, which makes them appear as if they are dancing. This dance is actually a form of farming for the species. By waving their claws around, the crab stirs up water around the symbiotic bacteria living in the setae on their claws. This ensures the bacteria are receiving enough chemicals that will provide energy to grow. By growing their own food, the yeti crab has a readily available resource of food in the harsh environment of the deep sea.
=== Reproductive behavior ===
Little is known about the mating behavior between yeti crabs. Much of what we know so far has been studied in Ki puravida. Ki puravida. Scientists have found that male crabs exhibit larger claws than females, suggesting that antagonistic interactions may occur between males competing for a female mate. This resembles a precopulatory guarding type mating system, which describes a set of mating behaviors found in decapods which consists of long interactions between a set of mates and higher levels of aggression in males. In another species, K K . tyleri, tyleri, males were observed to be found in groups closest to hydrothermal vents, while females were seen further away from these dense areas. This may be because egg-bearing females need to escape the high levels of heat near vents and move to a colder area in order to protect the development of their eggs. 
== Adaptations ==
One adaptation of the yeti crab species is the growth of its setae to farm bacteria in the species K. puravida K. puravida . There is some variation regarding the different types and various states of setae. There are two different types of setae that are organized adjacent to one another. Rows of narrow and flexible setae enclose the rows of more restricted, thicker setae. Because females slightly deviate from the vent environment during egg fertilization and larval development, brooding females contain more deteriorated, brown setae, as a result of their reduced carapace health away from the vent environment. 
An additional adaptation found in the species Kiwa (tyleri) Kiwa (tyleri) is the formation of a spine on the propodus (the end of the crab leg). This is beneficial for yeti crabs because they help the crustacean to cling to steep chimneys of hydrothermal vents. The stout, compact build of the crab also helps it traverse  hydrothermal vent environments. 
Scientists have found that male yeti crabs have larger claws than females, which may indicate that bigger claws are sexually selected for reproductive advantages. Previous research has suggested the claws are a mechanism of protection as scientists observed yeti crabs fighting with their claws or waving their claws to fend off predators. Bigger claws may also provide a better fitness advantage because they provide more surface area for symbiotic bacterial farming.

Babirusa,Babirusa,"
3–4, See text. See text. 
The babirusas babirusas , also called deer-pigs deer-pigs ( [Indonesian] Indonesian : babi rusa babi rusa ), are a [genus] genus , Babyrousa Babyrousa Babyrousa , in the [swine family] swine family found in the [Indonesian] Indonesian islands of [Sulawesi] Sulawesi , [Togian] Togian , [Sula] Sula and [Buru] Buru . All members of this genus were considered part of a single species until 2002, the babirusa, B. babyrussa B. babyrussa , but following that was split into several species. This scientific name is restricted to the [Buru babirusa] Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the [North Sulawesi babirusa] North Sulawesi babirusa , is named B. celebensis B. celebensis . The males have prominent upwards incurving canine tusks, which pierce the flesh in the snout. 
All species of babirusa are listed as threatened by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 
== Classification ==
The genus is [monotypic] monotypic within the [subfamily] subfamily Babyrousinae, or alternatively considered to form a [tribe] tribe , Babyrousini, of the subfamily [Suinae] Suinae . To date, only one fossil skull has been found to suggest a larger ancestor. 
All members of the genus were considered part of a single species, the babirusa or pig-deer, B. babyrussa B. babyrussa . After they were split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and the Sula Islands, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named B. celebensis B. celebensis . The split, which uses the [phylogenetic species concept] phylogenetic species concept , is based on differences in size, amount of hair on the body and tail-tuft, and measurements of the skull and teeth. 
=== Species ===
B. babyrussa beruensis B. babyrussa beruensis was described as an extinct, [Pleistocene] Pleistocene subspecies from southwestern Sulawesi before babirusas were split into multiple species.
== Description ==
Babirusas are notable for the long upper canines in the males. The upper canines of males emerge vertically from the [alveolar process] alveolar process , penetrating through the skin and curving backward over the front of the face and towards the forehead. The lower canines also grow upwards. The canines of females are either reduced or absent. The structure of the male's canines varies by species. In the golden babirusa, the upper canines are short and slender with the alveolar rotated forward to allow the lower canines to cross the lateral view. The Togian babirusa also has the same characteristics and the upper canines always converge. The North Sulawesi babirusa has long and thick upper canines with a vertically implanted alveolar. This causes the upper canines to emerge vertically and not cross with the lower canines. 
Babirusas also vary by species in other characteristics. The golden babirusa has a long, thick pelage that is white, creamy gold, black or gold overall, and black at the rump. The pelage of the Togian babirusa is also long but not as that of the golden babirusa. The Togian babirusa has a tawny, brown, or black pelage that is darker on the upper parts than in the lower parts. The North Sulawesi babirusa has very short hair and appears bald. The female babirusa has only one pair of [teats] teats . 
== Biology and ecology ==
Babirusas are native to [Sulawesi] Sulawesi , some of the [Togian Islands] Togian Islands , the [Sula Islands] Sula Islands , and [Buru] Buru . In Sulawesi, they range from the [Minahasa Peninsula] Minahasa Peninsula to the provinces of [South Sulawesi] South Sulawesi and [Southeast Sulawesi] Southeast Sulawesi . Although they are present on both Sulawesi and Sula, they are not found on the large islands between the two, the [Banggai Archipelago] Banggai Archipelago . It has been hypothesized that the unusual distribution may be due to their being transported by humans as gifts bestowed by native royalty. The preferred habitat of babirusa is tropical rainforest along river banks. It appears that they have been confined to the higher grounds in the interior despite occurring in lowland areas near coasts in the past. They are active during the daytime. Like all pig species, babirusa has an omnivorous diet with an intestinal tract similar to that of the domestic pig. The stomach [diverticulum] diverticulum of a babirusa is enlarged which may indicate that it is a [ruminant] ruminant but evidence shows otherwise. Because it does not have a rostral bone in the nose, a babirusa does not dig with its snout like other pigs do except in mud and swampy grounds. The diet of the babirusa includes leaves, roots, fruits and animal material. The strong jaws of a babirusa are capable of easily cracking hard nuts. 
Males tend to live solitarily while adult females can be found in groups with young. Groups of females and young may number up to 84 individuals, most of which contain no adult males. Males rarely travel in pairs or trios. There are almost never more than three adult females in a group. The tusks of the adult males are used in intraspecific fighting. The upper tusks are for defense while the lower tusks are offensive weapons. If a male babirusa does not grind his tusks (achievable through regular activity), they can eventually keep growing and, rarely, penetrate the individual's skull. 
Female babirusa cycle lengths are between 28 and 42 days and estrus last 2–3 days. The litter size for a babirusa is usually one or two piglets. 
== Relationship with humans ==
In Indonesia, the striking appearance of the babirusa has inspired demonic masks. 
The [Balinese] Balinese Hindu-era Court of Justice pavilion and the ""floating pavilion"" of [Klungkung] Klungkung palace ruins are notable for painted babirusa raksasa [raksasa] raksasa ( [grotesques] grotesques ) on the ceilings. 
Prehistoric paintings of babirusa found in caves on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia have been dated back at least 35,400 years (to the ice age Pleistocene epoch). [Adam Brumm] Adam Brumm , who co-authored the 2014 study dating the paintings, said ""The paintings of the wild animals are most fascinating because it is clear they were of particular interest to the artists themselves."" 
The babirusa has sparked debate among Jewish scholars and animal researchers about whether it is considered [kosher] kosher , or permissible to be consumed by Jews, according to [Jewish dietary laws] Jewish dietary laws . The debate centers around whether the animal chews its [cud] cud , which is a requirement according to the [Old Testament] Old Testament for an animal to be considered kosher. Some experts, like [J. David Bleich] J. David Bleich , a professor of [Jewish law] Jewish law and ethics at [Yeshiva University] Yeshiva University , believe that the babirusa does not meet the physical criteria to be considered kosher, challenging the assertion that the babirusa chews its cud by citing a report from 1940 that found that true rumination could not take place in the animal's stomach. However, he also notes that Jews can eat any food that is not expressly forbidden and that ""the babirusa's resemblance to a pig in appearance and taste is not sufficient grounds for banning its consumption as kosher meat."" Others, such as Fuller Bazer, an animal science professor at the University of Florida, believe that the animal is kosher due to its [cloven hoof] cloven hoof and cud chewing. Additionally, it has been noted that the babirusa is an endangered species and that most Muslims, who face similar dietary restrictions, would avoid eating the meat of any animal whose status in religious law is uncertain. 
== Conservation status ==
Babirusas are protected in Indonesia and killing them is illegal in most cases.  However, [poaching] poaching remains a significant threat to the babirusa.  Additionally, commercial logging operations threaten the babirusa by [habitat loss] habitat loss , and also reduce cover, making the babirusa more exposed to poachers. All [extant] extant species of babirusa are listed as [vulnerable] vulnerable or [endangered] endangered by the [IUCN] IUCN .

Enigmatiteuthis
Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis is a genus of [pelagic] pelagic  [cirrate (finned) octopods] cirrate (finned) octopods known as the dumbo octopuses dumbo octopuses . The name ""dumbo"" originates from their resemblance to the title character of [Disney] Disney 's 1941 film Dumbo [Dumbo] Dumbo , having two prominent ear-like fins which extend from the [mantle] mantle above each eye. There are 17 species recognized in the genus. 
Prey include [crustaceans] crustaceans , [bivalves] bivalves , worms and [copepods] copepods . The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years. 
== Range and habitat ==
Species of Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis are assumed to have a worldwide distribution, living in the cold, [abyssal] abyssal depths ranging from 1,000–7,000 metres (3,300–23,000 ft). Specimens have been found off the coasts of [Oregon] Oregon , the [Philippines] Philippines , [Martha's Vineyard] Martha's Vineyard , the [Azores] Azores , [New Zealand] New Zealand , [Australia] Australia , [California] California , [Papua] Papua and [New Guinea] New Guinea , and in the [Gulf of Mexico] Gulf of Mexico . 
A fairly recent observation was on 21 June 2022 at 1,250 metres (4,100 ft) by the vessel Normand Ocean Normand Ocean , which inspects [drilling platforms] drilling platforms with underwater drones; the vessel was examining chains and risers on the Aasta Hansteen platform outside [Trøndelag] Trøndelag , [Norway] Norway . The most recent observation as of 2023 was on 24 May 2023 at 2 108 108 meters, meters, this time in [Guyana] Guyana by the vessel Far Samson [Far Samson] Far Samson , which also uses underwater drones. 
Dumbo octopuses are the deepest living octopuses known, with some specimens captured or observed at [hadal] hadal depths. One Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis specimen was captured 60 kilometres (37 mi) southeast of [Grand Cayman] Grand Cayman at 7,279 metres (23,881 ft), but this depth is uncertain (as the specimen may have been captured while the net was descending to this depth). 
However, in 2020, Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis was spotted 6,957 metres (22,825 ft) deep in the [Java Trench] Java Trench , confirming the [hadal] hadal distribution of this genus. 
== Species and taxonomy ==
As noted below, many species collected on the [Challengerexpedition] Challenger Challenger expedition were initially classified in the genera Cirroteuthis [Cirroteuthis] Cirroteuthis and [Stauroteuthis] Stauroteuthis . Several species formerly classified as Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis were moved to genera Cirroctopus [Cirroctopus] Cirroctopus and Opisthoteuthis [Opisthoteuthis] Opisthoteuthis . A new family, Grimpoteuthididae (alternatively spelled [Grimpoteuthidae] Grimpoteuthidae ), has been proposed to accommodate Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis and those of genera Enigmatiteuthis Enigmatiteuthis , Cryptoteuthis [Cryptoteuthis] Cryptoteuthis , and Luteuthis [Luteuthis] Luteuthis . The persistent confusion and disparity about the taxonomy of these species has been attributed to the poor quality and limited number of specimens available for study. 
== Movement, characteristics, and food supply ==
Observations of animals in the Atlantic reveal that Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis often rest on the seafloor with the arms and web spread out and uses its arms to slowly crawl along the seafloor. When disturbed the webbing and arms are contracted to push the animal off the seafloor with it then transitioning to movement using the mantle fins for rapid locomotion. The cushiony cartilage that can be found in the proximal position of the fin of the octopus is responsible for acting as a support for the thick muscles that are attached, these muscles are what allow for rapid locomotion.
Although it has been suggested that species of Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis are capable of [jet-propulsion] jet-propulsion (while swimming using the fins), this has since been deemed unlikely. 
Feeding behavior has not been directly observed in Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis , but presumably is similar to Opisthoteuthis [Opisthoteuthis] Opisthoteuthis that trap small prey items in the webbing (either by enclosing the prey in the arm webbing or between the webbing and the seafloor) and then use the cirri (fingerlike projections along the arms) to move food to the mouth. Known prey items (from dissected animals) include benthic [polychaetes] polychaetes , [benthopelagic] benthopelagic  [copepods] copepods , [amphipods] amphipods and [isopods] isopods . 
== Breeding ==
The cirrate octopuses are classified as 'continuous spawners': Females carry multiple eggs in various stages of maturation, and only lay one or two eggs at a time, with no seasonality in spawning (however, most of these aspects of reproductive biology have only been confirmed in Opisthoteuthis Opisthoteuthis , not Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis ). Mating in cirrate octopuses has never been observed, and unlike other octopuses, members of Cirrata lack a [hectocotylus] hectocotylus for the transfer of sperm packets. Cirrate octopus eggs are large and have a tough casing surrounding the [chorion] chorion (not found in other octopuses), and Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis in particular attach their eggs to deep sea corals ( [octocorals] octocorals ). The female cirrate octopus does not guard or incubate the eggs (again unlike other octopuses).  Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis hatchlings emerge as ""fully competent"" juveniles with all of the sensory and motor features to survive on their own. 
[Sexual dimorphism] Sexual dimorphism between males and females is less noticeable and consistent in Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis compared to other cirrate octopuses (such as Opisthoteuthis Opisthoteuthis ). In some species (e.g., G. bathynectes G. bathynectes and G.. discoveryi G.. discoveryi ), the males have enlarged suckers relative to the females, but no such enlargement is found in other Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis species. 
== Threats ==
Species of Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis face few direct threats from humans, living at depths of 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) and below. Natural predators of cirrate octopuses include large [teleost] teleost fish and sharks, and even marine mammals such as sperm whales and seals, but these are mostly predators of other cirrate genera, and Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis has only been recorded in the stomach contents of a shark. 
The Grimpoteuthis Grimpoteuthis do not have an ink sac (as is the case with all cirrate octopuses). Furthermore, the cirrate octopuses lack innervated chromatophores and are therefore not capable of changing color (despite some unreferenced statements to the contrary). How cirrate octopuses escape or avoid predators is largely unknown.

Leafcutter Ant,Leafcutter ant,"Leafcutter ants Leafcutter ants are [fungus-growing ants] fungus-growing ants that share the behaviour of cutting leaves which they carry back to their nests to farm fungus. Next to humans, leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. In a few years, the central mound of their underground nests can grow to more than 30 m (98 ft) across, with smaller radiating mounds extending out to a radius of 80 m (260 ft), taking up 30 to 600 m (320 to 6,460 sq ft) and converted into 3.55 m individuals.
== Leafcutting groups ==
Leafcutter ants are any of at least 55 [species] species of leaf-chewing [ants] ants belonging to the three [genera] genera  Atta [Atta] Atta , Acromyrmex [Acromyrmex] Acromyrmex , and Amoimyrmex [Amoimyrmex] Amoimyrmex , within the tribe [Attini] Attini . These species of [tropical] tropical , [fungus-growing ants] fungus-growing ants are all [endemic] endemic to [South] South and [Central America] Central America , [Mexico] Mexico , and parts of the [southern United States] southern United States . Leafcutter ants can carry twenty times their body weight and cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as the nutritional substrate for their fungal cultivates. 
Acromyrmex Acromyrmex and Atta Atta ants have much in common anatomically; however, the two can be identified by their external differences. Atta Atta ants have three pairs of spines and a smooth [exoskeleton] exoskeleton on the upper surface of the [thorax] thorax , while Acromyrmex Acromyrmex ants have four pairs and a rough exoskeleton. The exoskeleton itself is covered in a thin layer of mineral coating, composed of rhombohedral crystals that are generated by the ants.  Amoimyrmex Amoimyrmex and Acromyrmex Acromyrmex differ in that Amoimyrmex Amoimyrmex lacks [tubercles] tubercles on the first gastral segment, and recent [phylogenetic] phylogenetic evidence shows that Amoimyrmex Amoimyrmex diverged before the other two genera of leafcutter ants. 
== Colony lifecycle ==
=== Reproduction and colony founding ===
Winged females and males leave their respective nests en masse en masse and engage in a [nuptial flight] nuptial flight known as the revoada revoada (Portuguese) or vuelo nupcial vuelo nupcial (Spanish). Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a [colony] colony . 
Once on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low, and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony. To start her own fungus garden, the queen stores bits of the parental fungus garden [mycelium] mycelium in her infrabuccal pocket, which is located within her oral cavity. Colonies are generally founded by individual queens – [haplometrosis] haplometrosis . Because colonies with multiple queens over the lifespan of the colony have been found by a large number of investigators – by Weber 1937, Jonkman 1977, Huber 1907, Moser & Lewis 1981, Mariconi & Zamith 1963, Moser 1963, and Walter et al 1938 – it is believable that some colonies have multiple foundresses – termed [pleometrosis] pleometrosis . Pleometrosis is confirmed only for Atta texana [Atta texana] Atta texana by Vinson 1985. 
=== Colony hierarchy ===
In leafcutter colonies, ants are divided into [castes] castes , based mostly on size, that perform different functions. Acromyrmex Acromyrmex and Atta Atta exhibit a high degree of [polymorphism] polymorphism , four castes being present in established colonies—minims, minors, mediae, and majors.  Majors are also known as soldiers or dinergates. Atta Atta ants are more polymorphic than Acromyrmex Acromyrmex , meaning comparatively less difference occurs in size from the smallest to largest types of Acromyrmex Acromyrmex . 
== Ant–fungus mutualism ==
Their societies are based on an [ant–fungus mutualism] ant–fungus mutualism , and different species of ants use different species of fungus, but all of the fungi the ants use are members of the family [Lepiotaceae] Lepiotaceae .  The ants actively cultivate their fungus, feeding it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from [pests] pests and [molds] molds .  This [mutualistic] mutualistic relationship is further augmented by another [symbiotic] symbiotic partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable [antimicrobials] antimicrobials .  Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it.  The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are [ambrosia beetles] ambrosia beetles and [termites] termites . The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so mutualism is obligatory.
The fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete. Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen [hyphal] hyphal tips ( [gongylidia] gongylidia ) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants.  Leucoagaricus gongylophorus [Leucoagaricus gongylophorus] Leucoagaricus gongylophorus is the most commonly documented fungi farmed by higher attine ant species. 
== Behaviour ==
Leafcutter ants have very specific roles in taking care of the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony's longevity. The necrotrophic parasitic fungus Escovopsis [Escovopsis] Escovopsis threatens the ants' food source and thus is a constant danger to the ants. The waste transporters and waste-heap workers are the older, more dispensable leafcutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger ants can work on the fungal garden. The Atta colombica [Atta colombica] Atta colombica species, unusually for the Attine tribe, have an external waste heap. Waste transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the waste heap. Once dropped off at the refuse dump, the heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition. A. colombica A. colombica have been observed placing dead ants around the perimeter of the waste heap. 
In addition to feeding the fungal garden with foraged food, mainly consisting of leaves, it is protected from Escovopsis Escovopsis by the antibiotic secretions of [Actinomycetota] Actinomycetota (genus Pseudonocardia [Pseudonocardia] Pseudonocardia ). This mutualistic micro-organism lives in the metapleural glands of the ant. Actinomycetota are responsible for producing the majority of the world's [antibiotics] antibiotics today.
Leafcutter ants use chemical communication and [stridulation] stridulation (substrate-borne vibrations) to communicate with each other. 
Leafcutter ants prefer [disturbed habitats] disturbed habitats , likely due to higher concentrations of [pioneer plant species] pioneer plant species . These are more attractive food sources because pioneer plants have lower levels of [secondary metabolites] secondary metabolites and higher [nutrient] nutrient concentrations than the shade-tolerant species that [will come later] will come later . 
== Parasites ==
When the ants are out collecting leaves, they are at risk of attack by some species of [phorid flies] phorid flies , [parasitoids] parasitoids that lay eggs into the crevices of the worker ants' heads.  Often, a minim will sit on a worker ant and ward off any attack. 
Also, the wrong type of fungus can grow during cultivation. Escovopsis Escovopsis , a highly virulent fungus, has the potential to devastate an ant garden, as it is horizontally transmitted. Escovopsis Escovopsis was cultured, during colony foundation, in 6.6% of colonies. However, in one- to two-year-old colonies, almost 60% had Escovopsis Escovopsis growing in the fungal garden. 
Nevertheless, leafcutter ants have many adaptive mechanisms to recognize and control infections by Escovopsis Escovopsis and other micro-organisms. The most common known behaviors rely on workers reducing the number of fungal spores by grooming, or removing an infected piece of the fungus garden and throwing it away at the waste dump (described as weeding). 
== Interactions with humans ==
In some parts of their range, leafcutter ants can be a serious agricultural pest, defoliating crops and damaging roads and farmland with their nest-making activities. For example, some Atta Atta species are capable of defoliating an entire citrus tree in less than 24 hours.
A promising approach to deterring attacks of the leafcutter ant Acromyrmex lobicornis [Acromyrmex lobicornis] Acromyrmex lobicornis on crops has been demonstrated. Collecting the refuse from the nest and placing it over seedlings or around crops resulted in a deterrent effect over a period of 30 days.

Hercules Beetle,Hercules beetle,"
The Hercules beetle Hercules beetle ( Dynastes hercules Dynastes hercules Dynastes hercules ) is a species of [rhinoceros beetle] rhinoceros beetle native to the [rainforests] rainforests of southern [Mexico] Mexico , [Central America] Central America , [South America] South America , and the [Lesser Antilles] Lesser Antilles . It is the [longest extant species of beetle] longest extant species of beetle in the world, and is also one of the largest flying insects in the world.
== Etymology ==
Dynastes hercules Dynastes hercules is known for its tremendous strength and is named after [Hercules] Hercules , a hero of [classical mythology] classical mythology who is famed for his great strength.
== Taxonomy ==
D. hercules D. hercules has a complex taxonomic history and has been known by several synonyms. It is in the subfamily [Dynastinae] Dynastinae (rhinoceros beetles) in the larger family [Scarabaeidae] Scarabaeidae (commonly known as scarab beetles). Not counting subspecies of D. hercules D. hercules , seven other species are recognized in the [genus] genus  Dynastes [Dynastes] Dynastes .
=== Subspecies ===
Several subspecies of D. hercules D. hercules have been named, though still some uncertainty exists as to the validity of the named taxa. 
== Description ==
Adult body sizes (not including the thoracic horn) vary between 50 and 85 mm (2.0 and 3.3 in) in length and 29 and 42 mm (1.1 and 1.7 in) in width. Male Hercules beetles may reach up to 173 mm (7 in) in length (including the horn), making them the longest species of beetle in the world, if jaws and/or horns are included in the measurement. The size of the horn is naturally variable, more so than any variation of the size of legs, wings, or overall body size in the species. This variability results from developmental mechanisms that coincide with genetic predisposition in relation to nutrition, stress, exposure to parasites, and/or physiological conditions. 
Dynastes hercules Dynastes hercules is highly [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic , with only males exhibiting the characteristic horns (one on the head, and a much larger one on the prothorax). The body of males is black with the exception of the [elytra] elytra , which can have shades of olive-green. They have a black suture with sparsely distributed black spots elsewhere on the elytra. They have a slightly iridescent coloration to their elytra, which varies in color between specimens and may be affected by the humidity of the local environment in which they develop. At low humidity the elytra are olive-green or yellow in color, but darken to black at higher humidity due to its hygrochromic properties. 
Females of D. hercules D. hercules have punctured elytra which are usually entirely black, but sometimes have the last quarter of the elytra colored in the same way as the males. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
Populations of D. hercules D. hercules may be found from southern Mexico to Bolivia in mountainous and lowland rain forests. Known populations include the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.  [Chromosomal analysis] Chromosomal analysis has shown that the genus Dynastes Dynastes originated from South America. 
== Life cycle ==
Not much is known about the life cycle in the wild, but much evidence has been gained through observations of captive-bred populations. The mating season for adults typically occurs during the [rainy season] rainy season (July to December). Females have an average gestation period of 30 days from copulation to egg-laying, and may lay up to 100 eggs on the ground or on dead wood. The eggs have an incubation period of approximately 27.7 days before they hatch. Once hatched, the [larval] larval stage of the Hercules beetle may last up to two years in duration, where it will go through 3 metamorphosis stages, also known as [instars] instars . The larvae have a yellow body with a black head. The larvae can grow up to 11 cm (4.5 in) in length and weigh more than 100 grams. In laboratory conditions at 25 ± 1° [C] C , the first instar stage lasts an average of 50 days, the second stage an average of 56 days, and the third an average of 450 days. After the third instar stage, the [pupal] pupal stage lasts about 32 days, where it will transition into an adult. Adult beetles can live for three to six months in captivity. 
== Diet and behavior ==
=== Diet ===
The larvae of the Hercules beetle are [saproxylophagous] saproxylophagous , meaning that they feed on rotting wood; they reside in same during their two-year developmental stage. The adult Hercules beetle feeds on fresh and rotting fruit, along with tree sap. Adults carve bark through the use of its synchronous mandibles to easily access the sap of trees. When these mandibles are closed, a narrow opening is formed which can act like a straw to allow consumption of tree sap. They have been observed feeding on peaches, pears, apples, grapes, bananas, and mangoes in captivity. 
=== Behavior ===
Within their native rain forest habitats, the adult beetles, which are nocturnal, forage for fruit at night and hide or burrow within the [leaf litter] leaf litter during the day. The adult D. hercules D. hercules beetles are capable of creating a 'huffing' sound, generated by [stridulating] stridulating their abdomen against their elytra to serve as a warning to predators. Like most insects, communication within the species is a mix of [chemoreception] chemoreception , sight, and mechanical perception. Experiments on D. hercules D. hercules have shown that a male placed in the vicinity of a female will immediately orient towards her and seek her out, suggesting chemical communication through strong sexual pheromones. 
=== Combat behavior between males ===
It has been observed in wild habitat and in captivity that male D. hercules D. hercules will engage in combat to win possession and mating rights to a female. Male Hercules beetles typically use their large horns to settle mating disputes; these fights can cause significant physical damage to the combatants but may also include possible damage to the female in the process. During fights, the males attempt to grab and pin their rival between the cephalic and thoracic horns to lift and throw them. The successful male wins mating rights with the female, though the beetles remain [polygynandrous] polygynandrous . 
=== Physical strength ===
Reports suggest the Hercules beetle is able to carry up to 850 times its body mass. Actual measurements on a much smaller (and relatively stronger: see [square-cube law] square-cube law ) species of rhinoceros beetle shows a carrying capacity only up to 100 times their body mass, at which point they can barely move. 
== Relationship to humans ==
Dynastes hercules Dynastes hercules does not negatively affect human activities, either as an agricultural pest or disease vector. The beetles can be kept as pets. Larvae excrement has been shown to contain β-mannanase, a bacterially synthesized enzyme that [hydrolyzes] hydrolyzes  [hemicellulose] hemicellulose that can be used in enzyme based cleaning products. β-mannanase has been successfully extracted and cloned from larvae fecal matter, suggesting that production of bio additive cleaning products may be feasible. 
== Relationship to the environment ==
Dynastes hercules Dynastes hercules is a beneficial contributor to the rain forest [ecosystem] ecosystem , primarily during their larval stage where they are saproxylophagous.  Feeding on rotting wood assists with [biodegradation] biodegradation and [cycling nutrients] cycling nutrients in the environment.

Helmeted Hornbill,Helmeted hornbill,"
Buceros vigil Buceros vigil  [Forster] Forster , 1781 
The helmeted hornbill helmeted hornbill ( Rhinoplax vigil Rhinoplax vigil Rhinoplax vigil ) is a very large [bird] bird in the [hornbill] hornbill family. It is found on the [Malay Peninsula] Malay Peninsula , [Sumatra] Sumatra , [Borneo] Borneo , Thailand and Myanmar. The casque (helmetlike structure on the head) accounts for some 11% of its 3 kg weight. Unlike any other hornbill, the casque is almost solid, and is used in head-to-head combat among males. It is a belief among the [Punan Bah] Punan Bah that a large helmeted hornbill guards the river between life and death. 
== Description ==
It has mostly blackish plumage, except that the belly and legs are white and the tail is white with a black band near the tip of each feather. The tail is long and the two central tail [feathers] feathers are much longer than the others, giving the bird a total length greater than that of any other hornbill species. The body length is 110–120 cm (43–47 in), not counting the tail feathers, which boost the length a further 50 cm (20 in). One male weighed 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) in weight while two females averaged about 2.7 kg (6.0 lb). Although sometimes considered the largest Asian hornbill, their body weight appears to be similar to that of the [great hornbill] great hornbill (and considerably less than the African [ground hornbills] ground hornbills ). 
This species has a bare, wrinkled throat patch, pale blue to greenish in females and red in males. The [casque] casque goes from the base of the [bill] bill halfway to the tip, where it ends abruptly. It and the bill are yellow; the red secretion of the [preen gland] preen gland covers the sides and top of the casque and the base of the bill, but often leaves the front end of the casque and the [distal] distal half of the bill yellow. Unlike other hornbills, the helmeted hornbill's casque is solid, and the skull including the casque and bill may constitute 10 percent of the bird's weight.
== Call ==
Their call is two parts, the first consisting of a series of loud, intermittent [barbet] barbet -like hoots, sometimes double-toned and over two dozen in number, which sound like the ""toop"" or ""took"" noise of an axe. These hoots gradually accelerates to climax in a cackle reminiscent of laughter; this is thought to advertise information about the caller, such as age, size, and fitness, to listening [conspecifics] conspecifics . Because of this call, the Helmeted Hornbill is also known in Malay as the ""Kill your mother in law"" bird (Tebang Mentua). It is said that there once was a man who disliked his mother in law so much that he chopped down the stilts that supported her house while she was still inside of it to get rid of her. As punishment, the gods transformed him into the Helmeted Hornbill and so he was condemned to relive his crime forever by mimicking the sound of an axe striking foundation posts, followed with cackling glee at the house crashing down. The calls are audible up to 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) away and can go on for minutes at a time.
== Habits ==
Helmeted hornbills mostly eat the fruit of [strangler figs] strangler figs . They are thought to be territorial and monogamous, although little is known about their social behavior. The birds breed once a year, producing a single chick. Mother and chick live inside a sealed tree cavity for the first five months of the chick's life. Their specialized nesting behavior makes them particularly vulnerable to poaching and deforestation. Males fight over territory on the wing, ramming each other with their casques. Such encounters are called aerial jousting. Females accompany males during an approach in an aerial joust but veer off in opposite directions during the collision. 
== Status ==
After ongoing hunting pressure and habitat loss, the helmeted hornbill was uplisted from [near threatened] near threatened to [critically endangered] critically endangered on the [IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2015. It is listed in Appendix I of [CITES] CITES . According to the conservation group [TRAFFIC] TRAFFIC , 2,170 casques were confiscated in just three years in China and Indonesia alone. There are fewer than 100 birds remaining in Thai forests. At least 546 hornbill parts, mostly casques of helmeted hornbills, have been posted for sale on Thai Facebook in the past five years. Traders will pay villagers 5,000-6,000 [baht] baht (US$165–200) for a hornbill head. Prices double or triple in cities and increase exponentially when sold overseas. No specimens are held in captivity. Both the [Jurong Bird Park] Jurong Bird Park and the Penang Bird Park previously held pairs.
== Ivory casque ==
The casque is the source of [hornbill ivory] hornbill ivory , a valuable carving material. Indigenous peoples also use the central tail feathers to decorate dancing cloaks and head-dresses.  Historically, the casque was also used by carvers in China and Japan. 
== Cultural significance ==
Along with the closely related [rhinoceros hornbill] rhinoceros hornbill , the Helmeted Hornbill is prominent in the cultural practices of many indigenous groups in northern [Borneo] Borneo . These birds are featured in various legends, symbolizing themes such as life, death, and bravery. In the [Punan Bah] Punan Bah culture, helmeted hornbills guard the passage between life and the afterlife and judge the worth of those who pass. This species is also associated with beliefs regarding headhunting. The [Orang Ulu] Orang Ulu of northeastern Malaysia only allowed those who has taken a head to wear the Helmeted Hornbill's feathers. Beyond spiritual symbolism, the bird's casques and feathers play a vital role in various rituals and ceremonies. The Orang Ulu carved elaborate grave markers, centerpieces, and ear-rings from hornbill casques. Many native peoples used the two long, central tail feathers to adorn ceremonial attire and weapons for weddings, funerals, and other official functions. Hornbills were traditionally hunted for their meat using blowpipes.

Dugite,Dugite,"
The dugite dugite ( [/ˈdjuːɡaɪt/] / ˈ ˈ dj dj uː uː ɡ ɡ aɪ aɪ t t / ; Pseudonaja affinis Pseudonaja affinis Pseudonaja affinis ) is a [species] species of [venomous] venomous , potentially lethal [snake] snake endemic to [Western Australia] Western Australia , a member of the [family] family  [Elapidae] Elapidae .
The word dugite is an [anglicisation] anglicisation of names for the snake in some dialects of the [Nyungar language] Nyungar language , including dukayj dukayj dukayj and dukitj dukitj dukitj . However, another, probably [cognate] cognate name, dobitj dobitj dobitj , has become the common name for dugites in Nyungar (a potential source of confusion, as dobitj dobitj dobitj is also used in some dialects to refer to other kinds of venomous snakes).
== Description ==
The dugite is a venomous snake, considered dangerous. It is coloured grey, green, or brown. The colours vary widely between individuals and are an unreliable means of identifying the species. Black scales can be scattered over the body; their scales are relatively large with a semi-glossy appearance. The most distinguishing characteristic is the head that can be rather small and indistinct from the neck. A dugite's body is long and slender in build and can grow up to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) in total length (including tail), but the typical size is roughly 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in).
== Distribution and habitat ==
P. affinis P. affinis is found in southern parts of Western Australia and in remote coastal parts of western [South Australia] South Australia .
The dugite occupies a wide variety of habitats ranging from coastal dunes and heathlands to shrub lands and woodlands. It also appears to thrive in heavily degraded habitats such as golf courses, industrial areas, and open agricultural farmlands.
The dugite has increased in population since the opening up of its natural habitats and introduction of the house mouse due to the mouse being a main food source for it. In the Perth metropolitan area, the dugite is one of the most common snakes found next to buildings. In areas of human population, the snake will take temporary shelter under concrete slabs, fibro sheeting, roofing tin, and such, although in more natural habitats, it will shelter under rocks and in abandoned termite mounds. It also burrows during the winter.
== Behaviour ==
In the wild, dugites may be sheltering beneath logs and rocks. When disturbed, they are very shy and often slither away, but they will defend themselves if cornered. The species is [diurnal] diurnal . On hot days, activity occurs mainly in the morning, and to a lesser extent in the afternoon.
== Diet ==
Like all snakes, P. affinis P. affinis is [carnivorous] carnivorous , eating [lizards] lizards , other snakes, [mice] mice and [rats] rats . 
== Reproduction ==
As with all [brown snakes] brown snakes , mating normally occurs between early September and late November. The dugite is an egg-laying ( [oviparous] oviparous ) snake, and typically deposits around 30 eggs and abandons them to self-incubate.  The eggs hatch after about 65 days.  Under optimal environmental conditions, the dugite has been known to lay two clutches during the same season.
== Envenomation ==
The venom of P. affinis P. affinis is potentially one of the most lethal in the world, causing [coagulopathic] coagulopathic and [procoagulant] procoagulant effects. Dugites generally avoid biting humans, but risks of encounters increase when they are most active during the mating season through October and November. 
The last human death attributed to a dugite was in August 2015 in [South Fremantle] South Fremantle , when a woman was bitten on her heel mid-afternoon while walking alone. She walked home and later collapsed whilst her husband was taking her to her car  to transport her to the hospital. The ambulance was called, arriving five minutes later, but medics were unable to revive her. 
In January 2011, a seven-year-old Perth boy was bitten and temporarily paralyzed after a dugite entered his bedroom and wrapped itself around his arm while he slept. After receiving immediate medical attention, he made a full recovery.
In December 2020, a three-year-old girl was bitten by a snake, believed to be a dugite, while playing in a courtyard at her grandmother's unit complex in Mandurah. Her grandmother quickly immobilised her and wrapped her legs in pressure bandages. The girl was treated with anti-venom in hospital and made a full recovery. 
== Taxonomy ==
The species was first described by [Albert Günther] Albert Günther in 1872. It is a member of the genus Pseudonaja [Pseudonaja] Pseudonaja , sometimes referred to as brown snakes, contained in the family Elapidae. The three [subspecies] subspecies descriptions currently accepted are: 
Note Note : A [trinomial authority] trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Pseudonaja Pseudonaja .
== In literature ==
Convicted Irish [Fenian] Fenian and civil rights activist, [John Boyle O'Reilly] John Boyle O'Reilly , celebrated a [bushman] bushman 's myth of the ""dukite"" in his popular poem ""The Dukite Snake"", which can be found in his 1878 collection Songs, Legends and Ballads Songs, Legends and Ballads :
… Now I'll change to a devil—ay, to a devil! You needn't start; if a spirit of evil Ever came to this world its hate to slake On mankind, it came as a Dukite Snake.   Like? Like? Like the pictures you've seen of Sin, A long red snake—as if what was within Was fire that gleamed through his glistening skin. And his eyes—if you could go down to hell, And come back to your fellows here and tell What the fire was like, you could find no thing, Here below on the earth, or up in the sky, To compare it to but a Dukite's eye!  Now, mark you, these Dukites don't go alone: There's another near when you see but one; And beware you of killing that one that you see Without finding the other; for you may be More than twenty miles from the spot that night; When camped, but you're tracked by the lone Dukite; That will follow your trail like Death or Fate And kill you as sure as you killed its mate. …
The book ran to at least seven editions, and the poem has been discussed and anthologized since.
In Chapter 16 of M. L Stedman's The Light Between Oceans The Light Between Oceans , Septimus Pott's wife, Hannah Roennfeldt's mother, Ellen, a debutante from Perth, Western Australia died within an hour after being bitten above the ankle by a dugite.

Goliath Birdeater,Goliath birdeater,"
The Goliath birdeater Goliath birdeater ( Theraphosa blondi Theraphosa blondi Theraphosa blondi ) belongs to the [tarantula] tarantula family [Theraphosidae] Theraphosidae . Found in northern [South America] South America , it is the largest [spider] spider in the world by mass (175 g (6.2 oz)) and body length (up to 13 cm (5.1 in)), and second to the [giant huntsman spider] giant huntsman spider by leg span. It is also called the Goliath tarantula Goliath tarantula or Goliath bird-eating spider Goliath bird-eating spider ; the practice of calling theraphosids ""bird-eating"" derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by [Maria Sibylla Merian] Maria Sibylla Merian that shows one [eating a hummingbird] eating a hummingbird . Despite the spider's name, it rarely preys on birds. 
== Characteristics ==
These spiders can have a leg span of up to 30 cm (12 in), a body length of up to 13 cm (5.1 in), and can weigh up to 175 g (6.2 oz). Birdeaters are one of the few tarantula species that lack tibial spurs, located on the first pair of legs of most adult males. They are mostly tan to light brown and golden-hued. 
== Life cycle ==
Unlike other species of spider/tarantula, females rarely [eat the males during mating] eat the males during mating . Females mature in 3–6 years and have an average lifespan of 15 to 25 years. Males die soon after maturity and have a lifespan of three to six years. Colors range from dark to light brown with faint markings on the legs. Bird-eaters have hair on their bodies, abdomens, and legs. The female lays 100 to 200 eggs, which hatch into spiderlings within 6–8 weeks. 
== Behaviour ==
=== Defenses ===
In response to threats, Goliath birdeaters [stridulate] stridulate by rubbing [setae] setae on their [pedipalps] pedipalps and legs. Also, when threatened they rub their abdomen with their hind legs and release hairs that are a severe irritant to the skin and [mucous membranes] mucous membranes . These [urticating hairs] urticating hairs can be harmful to humans. 
Like all tarantulas, T. blondi T. blondi spiders have [fangs] fangs large enough (2–4 cm or 0.79–1.57 in) to break the skin of a human. They carry [venom] venom in their fangs and have been known to bite when threatened, but the venom is relatively harmless and its effects are comparable to those of a [wasp] wasp 's sting. Tarantulas generally bite humans only in self-defense, and these bites do not always result in [envenomation] envenomation (known as a "" [dry bite] dry bite ”). 
=== Feeding ===
Despite its name,  the Goliath birdeater only rarely actually preys on birds; in the wild, its diet consists primarily of other large [arthropods] arthropods , [worms] worms , and [amphibians] amphibians . However, because of its size and opportunistic predatory behavior,  this species commonly kills and consumes a variety of [insects] insects and small terrestrial [vertebrates] vertebrates . They do not consume their prey in the open; rather, they drag it back to their burrow and begin the digesting process. They do this by liquefying the insides of their prey and proceed to suck it dry. In the wild, T. blondi T. blondi has been observed feeding on [rodents] rodents , [frogs] frogs , [toads] toads , [lizards] lizards , and even [snakes] snakes . 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Goliath birdeater is native to the upland [rainforest] rainforest regions of [Northern South America] Northern South America : [Suriname] Suriname , [Guyana] Guyana , [French Guiana] French Guiana , northern [Brazil] Brazil ,  eastern [Colombia] Colombia , and southern [Venezuela] Venezuela . Most noticeable in the [Amazon rainforest] Amazon rainforest , the spider is terrestrial, living in deep burrows, and is found commonly in [marshy] marshy or [swampy] swampy areas. It is a nocturnal species. 
== Culinary use ==
The Goliath birdeater is an [edible spider] edible spider . The spider is part of the local cuisine in northeastern South America, prepared by singeing off the [urticating hairs] urticating hairs and roasting it in banana leaves. The flavor has been described as ""shrimp-like"".

Atlas Moth,Attacus atlas,"
Attacus atlas Attacus atlas Attacus atlas , the Atlas moth Atlas moth , is a large [saturniid] saturniid  [moth] moth endemic to the forests of Asia. The [species] species was described by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 [10th edition ofSystema Naturae] 10th edition of Systema Naturae Systema Naturae .
The Atlas moth is one of the largest [lepidopterans] lepidopterans , with a wingspan measuring up to 24 cm (9.4 in) and a wing surface area of about 160 cm (≈25 in ). It is only surpassed in wingspan by the [white witch] white witch ( Thysania agrippina Thysania agrippina ) and Attacus caesar [Attacus caesar] Attacus caesar , and in wing surface area by the [Hercules moth] Hercules moth ( Coscinocera hercules Coscinocera hercules ). As in most [silk moths] silk moths , females are noticeably larger and heavier than males, while males have broader [antennae] antennae . 
== Description ==
=== Eggs ===
Atlas moths lay a number of spherical [eggs] eggs , 2.5 mm (0.098 in) in diameter, on the undersides of the leaves of food plants.
=== Larva ===
After approximately two weeks, dusty-green [caterpillars] caterpillars hatch and feed on their egg-shell, and then the foliage of [citrus] citrus , [cinnamon] cinnamon , [guava] guava , and [evergreen] evergreen trees. The caterpillars can grow to 11.5 cm (4.5 in) in length and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) in thickness. They have white, waxy, fleshy spines along their backs, which become more prominent at later [instars] instars . On the last abdominal segment beside the [prolegs] prolegs , there is a large green spot surrounded by an orange ring. 
=== Pupa ===
After reaching a length of about 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the caterpillars [pupate] pupate . They spin a 7–8 cm long papery [cocoon] cocoon interwoven with desiccated leaves and attach it to a twig using a strand of silk. The adult moths emerge from the cocoon after approximately four weeks depending on environmental factors.
=== Imago ===
Adult Atlas moths are weak, unsteady fliers. To conserve energy, the moths rest during the day and fly at night. As they lack fully formed [mouthparts] mouthparts , the adults cannot eat, subsisting entirely on fat reserves accumulated during the larval stage. As a result, they live for only a few days during which their sole objective is seeking out a mate. Adults may be found on wing throughout the year but are most abundant between November and January.
Females release [pheromones] pheromones through a gland on the end of the [abdomen] abdomen to attract a mate. Females stay near discarded [cocoons] cocoons , seeking out a perch where the air currents will best carry their pheromones. Males can detect and [home in] home in on these pheromones from several kilometers away using [chemoreceptors] chemoreceptors located on their feathery [antennae] antennae . 
The body is small compared to the wings. The upper side of the wings is reddish brown with a pattern of black, white, pink, and purple lines. There are triangular, scale-less windows bordered in black on each of the four wings. The undersides of the wings are paler. The tips of both forewings have prominent extensions that resemble the head of a snake. The resemblance is exaggerated by movements of the wings when the moth is confronted by potential predators.
The Atlas moth has a very short, vestigial proboscis, and they do not eat once they have emerged from the cocoon, relying on fat storage for energy. Every flight takes valuable energy and can take days off their already short lives, as it has a very short life span of only one to two weeks. They conserve energy by flying as little as possible. A female will wait for a male to come along and be fertilised, lay eggs and die.
== Habitat ==
Their [habitat] habitat is primarily dry [tropical forests] tropical forests , [secondary forests] secondary forests , and [shrublands] shrublands across [South Asia] South Asia , [East Asia] East Asia , and [Southeast Asia] Southeast Asia , including [Borneo] Borneo . 
== Etymology ==
Atlas moths are named after [Atlas] Atlas , the Titan of [Greek mythology] Greek mythology (due to their size). In [Hong Kong] Hong Kong , the [Cantonese] Cantonese means ""snake's head moth"", referring to the prominent extension of the forewing that resembles the head of a [snake] snake . 
== Relationship with humans ==
In [India] India , Atlas moths are cultivated for their [silk] silk in a non-commercial capacity. Unlike silk produced by the related [domestic silkmoth] domestic silkmoth ( Bombyx mori Bombyx mori ), Atlas moth silk is secreted as broken strands and is therefore less desirable. This brown, wool-like silk, known as fagara fagara , is thought to have greater durability. Atlas moth [cocoons] cocoons are sometimes used as small pocket change purses in [Taiwan] Taiwan . There is ongoing research as to whether the silk of the Atlas moth can be used as a substitute for common silks. The quality of the heavier cocoons, less restrictive rearing conditions, and competent properties of the fibers, make the silk produced by the Atlas moth a potential alternative for common silks. A study concluded that the silk fibers of the atlas moth had about an 80% higher density of cells and growth compared to the silk fibers of the silk moth. 
The [Japanese] Japanese subspecies A. a. ryukyuensis A. a. ryukyuensis , native to [Yonaguni] Yonaguni in the [Yaeyama Islands] Yaeyama Islands .
== Similar taxa ==
The term ""Atlas moth"" is sometimes used mistakenly as a name for any species in the genus Attacus [Attacus] Attacus , of which there are over 20 named species and subspecies. Attacus taprobanis [Attacus taprobanis] Attacus taprobanis native to [southern India] southern India and [Sri Lanka] Sri Lanka is very similar in morphology to the much more widely distributed Attacus atlas Attacus atlas . It was once considered a subspecies of A. atlas A. atlas . A few [New World] New World species can be mistaken for Atlas moths, specifically members of the genus Rothschildia [Rothschildia] Rothschildia . Very similar in appearance to the Asian Atlas moth, Rothschildia aurota [Rothschildia aurota] Rothschildia aurota is one of the largest members of its genus and a [Neotropical] Neotropical relative.

Pistol Shrimp,Alpheidae,"
Alpheidae Alpheidae (also known as the snapping shrimp snapping shrimp , pistol shrimp pistol shrimp or alpheid shrimp alpheid shrimp ) is a [family] family within the infraorder [caridea] caridea characterized by having asymmetrical claws, the larger of which is typically capable of producing a loud snapping sound.
The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 1,119 species within 38 or more genera. The two most prominent genera are Alpheus Alpheus and Synalpheus Synalpheus , with species numbering well over 330 and 160, respectively. Most snapping shrimp dig burrows and are common inhabitants of [coral reefs] coral reefs , submerged [seagrass] seagrass flats, and [oyster] oyster reefs. While most genera and species are found in tropical and temperate coastal and marine waters, Betaeus Betaeus inhabits cold seas and Potamalpheops Potamalpheops has a [cosmopolitan distribution] cosmopolitan distribution including being found in freshwater caves in Mexico.
When in colonies, the snapping shrimp can interfere with [sonar] sonar and [underwater communication] underwater communication . The shrimp are considered a major source of sound in the ocean. 
== Characteristics ==
Snapping shrimp grow to 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) in length.
Its disproportionately large claw, larger than half the shrimp's body, is a dimorphic addition to the arsenal of the shrimp. The claw can be on either arm of the body, and, unlike most shrimp claws, does not have typical [pincers] pincers at the end. Rather, it has a pistol-like feature made of two parts. A joint allows the ""hammer"" part to move backward into a right-angled position. When released, it snaps into the other part of the claw, emitting an enormously powerful wave of bubbles capable of stunning larger fish and breaking small glass jars. 
The claw snaps to create a [cavitation] cavitation bubble that generates [acoustic pressures] acoustic pressures of up to 80 kilopascals (12 psi) at a distance of 4 cm from the claw. As it ejects from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 25 m/s (90 km/h; 56 mph). The pressure is high enough to kill small fish. It corresponds to a peak [pressure level] pressure level of 218 [decibels] decibels relative to one [micropascal] micropascal (dB re 1 μPa), equivalent to a zero to peak source level of 190 dB re 1 μPa m. Au and Banks measured [peak to peak] peak to peak source levels between 185 and 190 dB re 1 μPa m, depending on the size of the claw. Similar values are reported by Ferguson and Cleary. The duration of the click is less than 1 [millisecond] millisecond .
The snap can also produce [sonoluminescence] sonoluminescence from the collapsing [cavitation] cavitation bubble. As it collapses, the cavitation bubble emits a short flash of light with a broad spectrum. If the light were of thermal origin it would require a temperature of the emitter of over 5,000 K (4,700 °C). In comparison, the surface temperature of the [Sun] Sun is estimated to be around 5,772 K (5,500 °C). The light is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the [naked eye] naked eye . It is most likely a by-product of the shock wave with no biological significance. However, it was the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect. It has subsequently been discovered that another group of [crustaceans] crustaceans , the [mantis shrimp] mantis shrimp , contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact. 
The snapping is used for hunting (hence the alternative name ""pistol shrimp""), as well as for communication. When hunting, the shrimp usually lies in an obscured spot, such as a burrow. The shrimp then extends its [antennae] antennae outwards to determine if any fish are passing by. Once it feels movement, the shrimp inches out of its hiding place, pulls back its claw, and releases a ""shot"" which stuns the prey; the shrimp then pulls it to the burrow and feeds on it. 
Snapping shrimp have the ability to reverse claws. When the snapping claw is lost, the missing limb will regenerate into a smaller claw and the original smaller appendage will grow into a new snapping claw. Laboratory research has shown that severing the nerve of the snapping claw induces the conversion of the smaller limb into a second snapping claw. The reversal of claw asymmetry in snapping shrimp is thought to be unique in nature. 
The snapping shrimp competes with much larger animals such as the [sperm whale] sperm whale and [beluga whale] beluga whale for the title of loudest animal in the sea. When in colonies, the snapping shrimp can interfere with [sonar] sonar and [underwater communication] underwater communication . The shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with [anti-submarine warfare] anti-submarine warfare . 
== Ecology ==
Some snapping shrimp species share burrows with [goby fish] goby fish in a mutualistic [symbiotic relationship] symbiotic relationship . The burrow is built and tended by the pistol shrimp, and the goby provides protection by watching out for danger. When both are out of the burrow, the shrimp maintains contact with the goby using its antennae. The goby, having better vision, alerts the shrimp of danger using a characteristic tail movement, and then both retreat into the safety of the shared burrow. This association has been observed in species that inhabit [coral reef] coral reef habitats.
[Eusocial] Eusocial behavior has been discovered in the genus Synalpheus [Synalpheus] Synalpheus . The species Synalpheus regalis [Synalpheus regalis] Synalpheus regalis lives inside [sponges] sponges in colonies that can number over 300. All of them are the offspring of a single large female, the queen, and possibly a single male. The offspring are divided into workers who care for the young and predominantly male soldiers who protect the colony with their huge claws. 
The snapping shrimp species will retain the same mate after copulation, making them monogamous. Most females of the Alpheidae species are susceptible to mating. Young females become receptive to males either just before (premolt stage) or after the puberty molt, making them physiologically mature and morphologically able to carry the egg mass. Male presence during the molt is beneficial for the female, as searching for a male during her soft-bodied receptive phase would put her at mortal risk. Mates have more success with partners having greater body mass. The larger shrimp are most successful. These animals practice mate guarding, leading to a decline in mate competition, as well as bonding of partners. The male and female will defend their shelter to protect both territory and young. Larva develop in three stages: The [nauplius larvae] nauplius larvae , [zoea] zoea , and [post larval] post larval stages.
== Genera ==
More than 620 species are currently recognised in the family Alpheidae, distributed among 52 genera. The largest of these are Alpheus [Alpheus] Alpheus , with 336 species, and Synalpheus [Synalpheus] Synalpheus , with 168 species. The following genera are recognised in the family Alpheidae:

Frilled Shark,Frilled shark,"
The frilled shark frilled shark ( Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus ), also known as the lizard shark, is one of the two [extant] extant species of shark in the [family] family  [Chlamydoselachidae] Chlamydoselachidae (the other is the [southern African frilled shark] southern African frilled shark , Chlamydoselachus africana Chlamydoselachus africana ). The frilled shark is considered a [living fossil] living fossil , because of its primitive, [anguilliform] anguilliform (eel-like) physical traits, such as a dark-brown color, [amphistyly] amphistyly (the articulation of the jaws to the cranium), and a 2.0 m (6.6 ft)–long body, which has [dorsal] dorsal , [pelvic] pelvic , and [anal fins] anal fins located towards the tail. The common name, frilled shark frilled shark , derives from the fringed appearance of the six pairs of [gill slits] gill slits at the shark's throat.
The two species of frilled shark are distributed throughout regions of the [Atlantic] Atlantic and the [Pacific] Pacific oceans, usually in the waters of the outer [continental shelf] continental shelf and of the upper [continental slope] continental slope , where the sharks usually live near the ocean floor, near [biologically productive] biologically productive areas of the ecosystem. To live on a diet of [cephalopods] cephalopods , smaller sharks, and [bony fish] bony fish , the frilled shark practices [diel vertical migration] diel vertical migration to feed at night at the surface of the ocean. When hunting food, the frilled shark curls its tail against a rock and moves like an eel, bending and lunging to capture and swallow whole prey with its long and flexible jaws, which are equipped with 300 recurved, needle-like teeth. 
Reproductively, the two species of frilled shark, C. anguineus C. anguineus and C. africana C. africana , are [aplacental viviparous] aplacental viviparous animals, born of an egg, without a [placenta] placenta to the mother shark. Contained within [egg capsules] egg capsules , the shark embryos develop in the body of the mother shark; at birth, the infant sharks emerge from their egg capsules in the [uterus] uterus , where they feed on [yolk] yolk . Although it has no distinct breeding season, the [gestation period] gestation period of the frilled shark can be up to 3.5 years long, to produce a litter of 2–15 shark pups. Usually caught as [bycatch] bycatch in [commercial fishing] commercial fishing , the frilled shark has some economic value as a meat and as [fishmeal] fishmeal ; and has been caught from depths of 1,570 m (5,150 ft), although its occurrence is uncommon below 1,200 m (3,900 ft); whereas in [Suruga Bay] Suruga Bay , Japan, the frilled shark commonly occurs at depths of 50–200 m (160–660 ft). 
== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The zoologist [Ludwig Döderlein] Ludwig Döderlein first identified, described, and classified the frilled shark as a discrete species of [shark] shark . After three years (1879–1881) of marine research in Japan, Döderlein took two specimen sharks to Vienna, but lost the [taxonomic] taxonomic manuscript of the research. Three years later, in the Bulletin of the Essex Institute Bulletin of the Essex Institute (vol. XVI, 1884) the zoologist [Samuel Garman] Samuel Garman published the first taxonomy of the frilled shark, based upon his observations, measurements, and descriptions of a 1.5-metre (4 ft 11 in)–long female shark from [Sagami Bay] Sagami Bay , Japan. In the article ""An Extraordinary Shark"" Garman classified the new species of shark within its own [genus] genus and [family] family , and named it Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus (eel-like shark with frills). The Graeco–Latin [nomenclature] nomenclature of the frilled shark derives from the Greek chlamy chlamy (frill) and selachus selachus (shark), and the Latin anguineus anguineus (like an eel); besides its [common name] common name , the frilled shark also is known as the ""lizard shark"" and as the ""scaffold shark"". 
The frilled-shark is considered a ""living fossil"", because its family lineage dates to the [Carboniferous] Carboniferous  [period] period . Initially, marine scientists considered the frilled shark a living, evolutionary representative of the extinct [elasmobranchii] elasmobranchii subclass of cartilaginous fish ( [rays] rays , sharks, [skates] skates , [sawfish] sawfish ), because the shark's body featured primitive anatomic traits, such as long jaws with trident-shaped, multi-cusp teeth; amphistyly amphistyly , the direct articulation of the jaws to the [cranium] cranium , at a point behind the eyes; and a quasi-cartilaginous [notochord] notochord (a proto-spinal-column) composed of indistinct [vertebrae] vertebrae . From that anatomy, Garman proposed that the frilled shark was related to the [cladodont] cladodont sharks of the Cladoselache [Cladoselache] Cladoselache genus that existed during the [Devonian period] Devonian period (419–359 [mya] mya ) in the [Palaeozoic era] Palaeozoic era (541–251 mya). In contrast to Garman's thesis, the ichthyologist [Theodore Gill] Theodore Gill and the paleontologist [Edward Drinker Cope] Edward Drinker Cope , suggested that the frilled shark's evolutionary tree indicated relation to the [Hybodontiformes] Hybodontiformes (hybodonts), which were the dominant species of shark during the [Mesozoic era] Mesozoic era (252–66 mya); and Cope categorized the Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus species to the fossil genus Xenacanthus [Xenacanthus] Xenacanthus that existed from the late Devonian period to the end of the [Triassic period] Triassic period of the Mesozoic era. 
The anatomic traits of body, muscle, and skeleton phylogenically include the frilled shark to the neoselachian [clade] clade (modern sharks and rays) which relates it to the [cow shark] cow shark , in the order Hexanchiformes [Hexanchiformes] Hexanchiformes . In addition, a genetic analysis conducted by researchers in 2016 may also suggest that the species is part of the order Hexanchiformes Hexanchiformes . Nonetheless, as a [systematist of biology] systematist of biology , the ichthyologist [Shigeru Shirai] Shigeru Shirai proposed the Chlamydoselachiformes Chlamydoselachiformes  [taxonomic order] taxonomic order exclusively for the C. anguinesis C. anguinesis and the C. africana C. africana species of frilled sharks. As a marine animal, the frilled shark is a [living fossil] living fossil because of its relatively unchanged anatomy and physique, since first appearing in the primeval seas of the [Late Cretaceous] Late Cretaceous (c. 95 mya) and the [Late Jurassic] Late Jurassic (150 mya) epochs. In [evolutionary] evolutionary terms, the frilled shark is an animal species of recent occurrence in the [natural history] natural history of the Earth; the earliest discoveries of the fossilized teeth of the Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus species of shark date to the early [Pleistocene] Pleistocene epoch (2.58–0.0117 mya). In 2009, marine biologists identified, described, and classified the Chlamydoselachus africana Chlamydoselachus africana (southern African frilled shark) of the Atlantic waters of southern Angola and of southern Namibia as a species of frilled shark different from the Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus identified in 1884. 
== Habitat and distribution ==
The habitats of the frilled shark include the waters of the outer [continental shelf] continental shelf and the upper-to-middle [continental slope] continental slope , favoring [upwellings] upwellings and other [biologically productive] biologically productive areas. Usually, the shiver lives close to the ocean floor, yet its diet of [cephalopods] cephalopods , smaller sharks, and [bony fish] bony fish , indicates that the frilled shark practices [diel vertical migration] diel vertical migration , and swims up to feed at night at the surface of the ocean. In their [Atlantic] Atlantic - and [Pacific] Pacific -ocean habitats, frilled sharks practice [spatial segregation] spatial segregation determined by the individual size, the sex, and the reproductive condition of each shark in the shiver. In [Suruga Bay] Suruga Bay , on the Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan, the frilled shark is most common at the depth of 50–200 m (160–660 ft), except in the August-to-November period, when the temperature at the 100 m (330 ft) water-layer exceeds 15 °C (59 °F), and then the sharks swim into deeper, cooler water. 
In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the frilled shark occurs off northern [Norway] Norway , northern [Scotland] Scotland , and western [Ireland] Ireland , ranging from [France] France to [Morocco] Morocco , the archipelago of [Madeira] Madeira , and the coast of [Mauritania] Mauritania , in northwest Africa. In the central Atlantic Ocean, the frilled shark has been caught along the region of the [Mid-Atlantic Ridge] Mid-Atlantic Ridge , ranging from north of the [Azores] Azores islands to the [Rio Grande Rise] Rio Grande Rise , off southern [Brazil] Brazil , and the Vavilov Ridge, off [West Africa] West Africa . Frilled sharks tend to be very solitary organisms; interacting with multiple individuals of their kind is rare. However, in the late 2000s a large capture was made over an underwater seamount of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, hauling in over 30 frilled sharks. The mass capture of a wide variety of male and female specimens emphasized these seamounts as a location for the mating of the species. In the western Atlantic, the frilled shark occurs in the waters of [New England] New England and [Georgia] Georgia , in the US, and in the waters of [Suriname] Suriname , in the northeastern coast of South America. 
In the western Pacific Ocean, the frilled shark ranges from southeastern [Honshu] Honshu , [Japan] Japan , north to [Taiwan] Taiwan , off the coast of China, to the coast of [New South Wales] New South Wales , Australia, and the islands of [Tasmania] Tasmania and [New Zealand] New Zealand . In the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, the frilled shark occurs in the regional waters of [Hawaii] Hawaii and the coast of [California] California , in the US, and the northern coast of [Chile] Chile , in western South America. Although it has been caught at the depth of 1,570 m (5,150 ft), the frilled shark usually does not occur deeper than 1,000 m (3,300 ft). 
== Description ==
The eel-like bodies of C. anguineus C. anguineus and C. africana C. africana differ anatomically; C. anguineus C. anguineus has a longer head and shorter gill slits, a spinal column with more vertebrae (160–171 vs. 147), and a lower-intestine [spiral valve] spiral valve with more turns (35–49 vs. 26–28) than does C. africana C. africana . The skin color of either species ranges from uniformly dark-brown to uniformly grey. In addition, C. anguineus C. anguineus has smaller pectoral fins than C. africana C. africana , and the mouth is narrower. The recorded, maximum body-length of a male frilled shark is 1.7 m (5.6 ft), and the recorded, maximum body-length of a female frilled shark is 2.0 m (6.6 ft). 
The head of the frilled shark is broad and flat, with a short, rounded snout. The [nostrils] nostrils are vertical slits, separated by a flap of skin that forms the incurrent opening and the excurrent opening. The moderately large eyes are horizontal ellipsoids, which have no [nictitating membrane] nictitating membrane , which is a protective, third-eyelid. Ligaments articulate the long jaws to the cranium,  and the corners of the mouth have neither furrows nor folds. The jaws contain 300 trident-shaped teeth, each needle-tooth has a cusp and two cusplets; the rows of teeth are widely spaced, with 19–28 tooth rows in the upper jaw, and 21–29 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Frilled sharks are able to open jaws and devour food sources that are considerably greater than that of their size, this is a physical trait that is present in [gulper eels] gulper eels and [viperfish] viperfish . At the throat, there are six pairs of long [gill slits] gill slits ; the first pair of gill slits form a collar, while the extended tips of the [gill filaments] gill filaments create a fleshy frill, hence, the frilled shark frilled shark name of this fish. 
The [pectoral fins] pectoral fins are short and rounded; the single, small [dorsal fin] dorsal fin has a rounded margin, and is positioned at the far end of the body, approximately opposite the [anal fin] anal fin . The [pelvic] pelvic and the anal fins are large, broad, and rounded, and are positioned to the tail-end of the frilled shark's body. The very long [caudal fin] caudal fin is a triangular tail that has neither a lower lobe nor a ventral notch in the upper lobe, and has a margin equipped with sharp, chisel-shaped [dermal denticles] dermal denticles , which the shark can enlarge. The underside of the shark's eel-like body features a pair of long, thick folds of skin, separated by a groove, which run the length of the belly; the function of the ventral skin-folds is unknown. In the female frilled shark, the mid-section is of the body longer, with the pelvic fins located closer to the anal fin. 
== Biology and ecology ==
A cartilaginous skeleton and a large [liver] liver (filled with low-density [lipids] lipids ) are the mechanical means with which the frilled shark controls and maintains its [buoyancy] buoyancy in the deep waters of the ocean. The shark has an open, [lateral-line organ system] lateral-line organ system featuring [mechanoreceptor] mechanoreceptor hair cells in grooves exposed to the ocean environment; such a [basal clade] basal clade configuration enhances the frilled shark's perception and detection of changes in the movement, the vibration, and the pressure of the surrounding water. Like all animals, the frilled shark is afflicted by [parasites] parasites , such as the Monorygma Monorygma  [tapeworm] tapeworm , the [trematoda] trematoda flatworm, the Otodistomum veliporum Otodistomum veliporum , and the Mooleptus rabuka Mooleptus rabuka  [nematode] nematode ; and by [predators] predators , such as other sharks, as indicated by missing tail-tips lost to a hungry attacker. 
In New Zealand, the [Takatika Grit] Takatika Grit , in the [Chatham Islands] Chatham Islands , yielded frilled-shark, bird, and conifer-cone fossils that dated to the time of the [Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary] Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (66.043 ± 0.011 mya) which suggested that the sharks lived inland, in shallow bodies of water far from the ocean. The shallow-water frilled shark had larger, stronger teeth, suitable for eating [mollusks] mollusks ; scarcity and plenty of food are indicated in the tooth's morphology of sharper points (cusps) oriented into the mouth. From the [Late Paleocene epoch] Late Paleocene epoch (66–56 mya) until the contemporary era, other species of sharks out-matched the Chlamydoselachus Chlamydoselachus sharks in competition for feeding grounds and living space, which restricted their geographic distribution to the deep-water ocean. Regarding the frilled shark's survival of the [mass-extinction event] mass-extinction event which occurred at the Cretaceous–Paleogene time-boundary, one hypothesis proposes that the sharks survived in bodies of shallow water, both inland and on the continental shelf; afterwards, the frilled shark migrated to deep-water habitats. 
=== Diet ===
The frilled shark eats a diet of [cephalopods] cephalopods , [Nudibranchs] Nudibranchs , smaller sharks, and [bony fish] bony fish ; 60 percent of the diet is composed of [squid] squid varieties, such as the Chiroteuthis [Chiroteuthis] Chiroteuthis , the Histioteuthis [Histioteuthis] Histioteuthis , and the Onychoteuthis [Onychoteuthis] Onychoteuthis , the Sthenoteuthis [Sthenoteuthis] Sthenoteuthis and the Todarodes [Todarodes] Todarodes ; and other sharks, as indicated by the stomach contents of a 1.6 m (5.2 ft)–long frilled shark which had swallowed a 590 g (1.30 lb) [Japanese catshark] Japanese catshark ( Apristurus japonicus Apristurus japonicus ). The high tendency to primarily consume the squids in their habitat can be supported by the frequent observation of beak remnants left behind during digestive processes. Because frilled sharks live on the ocean floor, they may also feed on [carrion] carrion floating down from the surface. 
In hunting and eating prey that are tired or exhausted or dying (after [spawn] spawn ), the frilled shark's physiology suggests that it may curve its anguilline body, and brace its rear fins against the water, for leverage to effect a rapid-strike bite that captures the prey. The wide gape of the distended, long jaws allows devouring whole prey that are more than half the size of the frilled shark, itself. The jaws' 300 recurved teeth (19–28 upper rows and 21–29 lower rows) readily snag and capture the soft body and tentacles of a [cephalopod] cephalopod , especially with the rows of trident-shaped teeth are rotated outwards, when the jaws are open and protruded. Moreover, unlike the strong bite of sharks with an underslung jaw attached below the cranium, the frilled shark has a relatively weak bite, because of the limited leverage and force possible with long jaws that are directly articulated to the cranium, at a point behind the eyes. 
The behavior of captive specimen sharks suggests that the frilled shark also hunts with its mouth open, by using the dark-and-light contrast of white teeth and darkness to lure prey into its gaping maw; and also hunts with [negative pressure] negative pressure , to suck prey into its maw. Forensic examination of frilled sharks' revealed little-to-no food in their stomachs, which suggests that the frilled shark either has a fast-rate of [digestion] digestion or goes hungry in the long intervals between feedings. 
=== Reproduction ===
The extant species of frilled shark, C. anguineus C. anguineus and C. africana C. africana , do not have a defined breeding season, because their oceanic habitats register no seasonal influence from the ocean's surface; the male shark reaches [sexual maturity] sexual maturity when he is 1.0–1.2 m (3.3–3.9 ft) long, and the female shark reaches sexual maturity when she is 1.3–1.5 m (4.3–4.9 ft) long. The mature female shark has two [ovaries] ovaries and a [uterus] uterus , which is in the right side of her body; ovulation occurs fortnightly; and pregnancy ceases [vitellogenesis] vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the production of new ova. Both ovulated eggs and early-stage shark embryos are enclosed in [chondrichthyes] chondrichthyes , ellipsoid egg-cases made of a thin, golden-brown membrane. 
Reproductively, the frilled shark is an [ovoviviparous] ovoviviparous animal born from an encapsulated egg retained within the mother shark's uterus. During [gestation] gestation , the shark embryos develop in membranous egg-cases contained within the body of the mother shark, when the infant sharks emerge from their egg capsules in the [uterus] uterus they feed on [yolk] yolk until birth. The frilled-shark embryo is 3.0 cm (1.2 in) long, has a pointed head, slightly developed jaws, nascent external gills, and possesses all fins. The growth of the jaw for elasmobranchs seem to begin early in the embryonic stage, however, it has been observed not to be the case for frilled sharks. The elongation of the jaws seemed to begin later in embryonic development. This leads to some studies suggesting that the terminal position of their mouth, due to anterior elongation of the jaw, is a derived trait instead of ancestral. When the embryo is 6–8 cm (2.4–3.1 in) long, the mother shark expels the egg capsule, at which developmental stage the frilled shark's external gills are developed. Throughout embryonic development, the size of the [yolk sac] yolk sac remains constant, until the shark embryo is 40 cm (16 in) long, whereupon the sac shrinks until disappearing when the embryo has grown to 50 cm (20 in) in length. In the course of pregnancy, the embryo's average rate-of-growth is 1.40 cm (0.55 in) per month until birth, when the shark pups are 40–60 cm (16–24 in) long, therefore, the frilled shark's [gestation period] gestation period can be as long as 3.5 years; at birth, a frilled shark's litter comprises 2–15 pups, with an average litter comprises 6.0 pups. 
== Human interactions ==
In pursuit of food, the frilled shark usually is a [bycatch] bycatch of commercial fishing, accidentally caught in the nets used for [trawl] trawl -, [gillnet] gillnet -, and [longline] longline -fishing. In Japan, at Suruga Bay, the frilled shark is usually caught in the gillnets used to catch [sea bream] sea bream and [gnomefish] gnomefish , and in the trawl nets used to catch [shrimp] shrimp in the mid-waters of the ocean. Despite being a nuisance fish that damages fishing nets, the economic and commercial value of the frilled shark is as [fishmeal] fishmeal and as meat. 
In 2004, [marine biologists] marine biologists first observed the frilled shark ( Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus ) at the depth of 873.55 m (2,866.0 ft), in its deep-water habitat at the [Blake Plateau] Blake Plateau , off the southeastern coast of the U.S. In 2007, a Japanese fisherman caught a 1.6 m (5.2 ft)–long female frilled shark at the surface of the ocean and delivered it to the Awashima Marine Park, at [Shizuoka city] Shizuoka city , where the shark died after hours of captivity. In 2014, a trawler fishing-boat caught a 1.5 m (4.9 ft)–long frilled shark in 1.0 km (3,300 ft)–deep water at [Lakes Entrance, Victoria] Lakes Entrance, Victoria , Australia; later, the [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation] Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) confirmed that the shark was a Chlamydoselachus anguineus Chlamydoselachus anguineus , an eel-like shark with a frill. 
In 2016, consequent to the depletion of food sources caused by commercial overfishing of the [feeding areas] feeding areas of the shark's deep-water habitat, and because of the shark's slow rate of reproduction, the [International Union for the Conservation of Nature] International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified the frilled shark as a fish species under [near-threat] near-threat of extinction, and then reclassified it as a species of [Least Concern] Least Concern of extinction. In 2018, the [New Zealand Threat Classification System] New Zealand Threat Classification System identified the frilled shark as an animal ""At Risk — Naturally Uncommon"", not easily found living in the wild.

Sand Cat,Sand cat,"
The sand cat sand cat ( Felis margarita Felis margarita Felis margarita ) is a small wild [cat] cat that inhabits sandy and stony [deserts] deserts far from water sources. With its sandy to light grey fur, it is well camouflaged in a desert environment. Its head-and-body length ranges from 39–52 cm (15–20 in) with a 23–31 cm (9.1–12.2 in) long tail. Its 5–7 cm (2.0–2.8 in) short ears are set low on the sides of the head, aiding detection of prey moving underground. The long hair covering the soles of its [paws] paws insulates its pads against the extreme temperatures found in deserts.
The first sand cat known to scientists was discovered in the [Algerian] Algerian  [Sahara] Sahara and [described] described in 1858. To date, it has been recorded in several disjunct locations in [Western Sahara] Western Sahara , [Morocco] Morocco , [Algeria] Algeria , [Niger] Niger , [Chad] Chad , [Egypt] Egypt , the [Arabian Peninsula] Arabian Peninsula and the [Middle East] Middle East . In [Central Asia] Central Asia , it was first recorded in the [Karakum Desert] Karakum Desert in 1925. The large gap between these two regions of its global range was partially closed in 1948, when a sand cat skin was found in an [oasis] oasis of the [Rub' al Khali] Rub' al Khali in [Oman] Oman . It is discontinuously distributed in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. In the early 1970s, sand cats were caught in southwestern [Pakistan] Pakistan and exported to zoos worldwide. Due to its wide distribution and large population, it is listed as [Least Concern] Least Concern on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List .
The sand cat usually rests in underground dens during the day and hunts at night. It moves 5.4 km (3.4 mi) on average at night in search of small [rodents] rodents and [birds] birds . It also kills and consumes [venomous snakes] venomous snakes . In spring, the female gives birth to two to three kittens, which become [sexually mature] sexually mature around the age of one year. The sand cat's ecological requirements are still poorly understood, as only a few in-depth studies targeting wild sand cat populations have been conducted.
== Taxonomy ==
Felis margarita Felis margarita was the [scientific name] scientific name proposed by [Victor Loche] Victor Loche in 1858 who first described a sand cat specimen found in the area of ""Négonça"" in the northern Algerian Sahara. This [holotype] holotype specimen appears to have been lost. The species was named after the French General [Jean Auguste Margueritte] Jean Auguste Margueritte . 
In the 20th century, the following [zoological specimens] zoological specimens of sand cats were described:
In 1974, F. m. margarita F. m. margarita , F. m. thinobia F. m. thinobia and F. m. scheffeli F. m. scheffeli were temporarily recognized as [valid] valid  [taxa] taxa . At the time, it was considered possible that sand cats eventually recorded in Afghanistan and [Iran] Iran might constitute distinct subspecies. In 2005, F. m. margarita F. m. margarita , F. m. thinobia F. m. thinobia , F. m. scheffeli F. m. scheffeli and F. m. harrisoni F. m. harrisoni were recognised as valid taxa by [W. Chris Wozencraft] W. Chris Wozencraft , who considered F. m. meinertzhageni F. m. meinertzhageni and F. m. aïrensis F. m. aïrensis  [synonyms] synonyms of the [nominate subspecies] nominate subspecies  F. m. margarita F. m. margarita . The Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group reviewed the existing information and in 2017 recognized only two subspecies based on [morphological] morphological differences, namely: 
Analysis of [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA of 47 individuals from across the sand cat's range showed that their [haplotypes] haplotypes differed only by one to three [base pair] base pair  [mutations] mutations . This low degree of genetic differentiation between the African and Asian sand cats indicates that the [Sinai Peninsula] Sinai Peninsula may have been a barrier to [gene flow] gene flow . 
=== Phylogeny ===
[Phylogenetic] Phylogenetic analysis of the [nuclear DNA] nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the [evolutionary radiation] evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the [Miocene] Miocene around [14.45 to 8.38] 14.45 to 8.38 million years ago . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around [16.76 to 6.46] 16.76 to 6.46 million years ago . The sand cat is part of an [evolutionary] evolutionary  [lineage] lineage that is estimated to have [genetically diverged] genetically diverged from the [common ancestor] common ancestor of the Felis Felis species around [4.44 to 2.16] 4.44 to 2.16 million years ago , based on analysis of their nuclear DNA. Analysis of their mitochondrial DNA indicates a genetic divergence of the Felis Felis species at around [6.52 to 1.03] 6.52 to 1.03 million years ago . Both models agree that the [jungle cat] jungle cat ( F. chaus F. chaus ) was the first Felis Felis species that diverged, followed by the [black-footed cat] black-footed cat ( F. nigripes F. nigripes ) and then the sand cat. It migrated into Africa, possibly during [Pleistocene glaciation] Pleistocene glaciation events.  [Migration] Migration was likely facilitated by extended periods of low sea levels between continents. 
A [fossil] fossil jaw and other [skeletal] skeletal remains of a sand cat were [excavated] excavated in a [Late Pleistocene] Late Pleistocene cave in El Harhoura located near [Temara] Temara in Morocco.

== Characteristics ==
The sand cat's fur is of a pale, sandy, [isabelline] isabelline colour, but much lighter on the lower part of the head, around the nose, throat, and on the belly. A faint reddish line runs from the outer corner of each eye across the cheeks. There are dark brown to blackish bars on the limbs, and the tail has a black tip with two or three dark rings alternating with buff bands. Markings vary between individuals: some have neither spots nor stripes, some are faintly spotted, some have both spots and stripes. Its head is sandy brown. The large, greenish-yellow eyes are ringed with white, and the nose is blackish. Its whiskers are white and up to 8 cm (3.1 in) long. Its ears are tawny at the base and tipped with black. Its [outer ear] outer ear is similar to that of a domestic cat, but its ear canal is about twice the size. The magnitude of acoustic input-admittance is about five times higher than of a domestic cat. Additionally, hearing sensitivity of the sand cat is about 8 [decibels] decibels greater than that of the domestic cat. 
In Central Asia, the sand cat's winter coat is very long and thick, with hairs reaching up to 51 mm (2 in) in length. Its claws on the forelimbs are short and very sharp, and claws on the hind feet are small and blunt. The undersides of its paws are protected from extreme temperatures by a thick covering of fur. The long hairs growing between its toes create a cushion of fur over the foot pads, helping to insulate them while moving over hot sand. This feature makes the cat's tracks obscure and difficult to identify and follow. 
The sand cat is characterized by a flat, wide head, short legs, and a relatively long tail of 23–31 cm (9.1–12.2 in). It stands 24–36 cm (9.4–14.2 in) at the shoulder and weighs 1.5–3.4 kg (3.3–7.5 lb). The head-and-body length ranges from 39–52 cm (15–20 in). The 5–7 cm (2.0–2.8 in) long ears are set low, giving a broad, flat appearance to the head. 
Its [skull] skull is arched in lateral outline with wide [zygomatic arches] zygomatic arches . The [pinnae] pinnae of the ears are triangular, and the [ear canal] ear canal is very wide, giving the cat an enhanced sense of hearing. The [auditory bullae] auditory bullae and the passages from the external ears to the [ear drums] ear drums are greatly enlarged compared to other small wild cats; the inner parts of the ears are protected from foreign objects by long, closely spaced white hairs. It has a [bite force] bite force at the [canine] canine tip of 155.4 [Newton] Newton and a [bite force quotient] bite force quotient at the canine tip of 136.7. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The sand cat inhabits both sandy and stony deserts. It is widely but not contiguously distributed in the deserts of North Africa and Southwest and Central Asia. It prefers flat or undulating terrain with sparse vegetation of grasses or small bushes; it avoids bare and shifting [sand dunes] sand dunes , where little prey is available. 
In the [Western Sahara] Western Sahara , sand cats were sighted and photographed in the [Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab] Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab region several times between 2005 and 2016. Sand cat kittens that had been hiding beneath a tuft of Panicum turgidum [Panicum turgidum] Panicum turgidum grass were sighted and photographed in the area in April 2017. In Algeria, one individual was recorded near a [salt cedar] salt cedar mound in the [Ahaggar Mountains] Ahaggar Mountains in 2008. No confirmed records are known in [Mauritania] Mauritania , [Tunisia] Tunisia and [Libya] Libya . In [Mali] Mali 's [Lake Faguibine] Lake Faguibine area, one individual was shortly sighted by night in 2011. In the [Ténéré] Ténéré Desert, sand cats were observed in the 1980s and between 2008 and 2015. Sightings in [Egypt] Egypt 's rocky [Western] Western and [Eastern Deserts] Eastern Deserts date to the mid 1980s. In the Sinai peninsula, sand cats were sighted in the mid 1990s. 
On the Arabian Peninsula, a sand cat skin was discovered by [Wilfred Thesiger] Wilfred Thesiger in 1948 in an oasis of the Rub' al Khali desert. In [Saudi Arabia] Saudi Arabia 's [Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area] Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area , sand cats were captured and encountered trapped in wire mesh fence surrounding the adjacent [Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve] Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve in the country's [Najd] Najd region. In the [Tabuk Region] Tabuk Region , two sand cats were killed by hunters in 2013 and 2016; and one individual was captured by a local farmer in 2014 and kept in a cage. Sand cats were also observed in 2014–2015 in three localities in the [Turaif] Turaif area in northern Saudi Arabia. In ['Uruq Bani Ma'arid] 'Uruq Bani Ma'arid on the western edge of the Rub' al Khali, sand cats use [gravel] gravel valley and sand dune habitats in the cool season from October to April; in the hot season from May to September, they mainly use sand dune habitat. In [Al Ain Region] Al Ain Region of the [Emirate of Abu Dhabi] Emirate of Abu Dhabi , a sand cat was sighted in a gravel plain between dunes in 2003. Several sand cats were recorded in a protected area in [Al Dhafra, Abu Dhabi] Al Dhafra, Abu Dhabi between April and December 2015, after an absence of sightings for ten years. In Oman's [Dhofar Governorate] Dhofar Governorate , it was recorded at several locations between 2021 and 2022. 
In southern [Israel] Israel , four sand cats were [radio-collared] radio-collared and tracked over a few months in the late 1980s in the [Arabah] Arabah Valley, which lies mostly in [Jordan] Jordan . The monitored sand cats frequently roamed in military camps of the Israeli army and crossed the international border. Since 2002, the sand cat is considered [locally extinct] locally extinct in Israel, as it has not been recorded since the turn of the century. In Jordan, a sand cat was sighted for the first time in 1997 during a survey in a desert area in the eastern part of the country. In [Syria] Syria , sand cats were sighted and photographed by a [camera-trap] camera-trap in a protected area near [Palmyra] Palmyra in 2000 and 2001. In western [Iraq] Iraq , sand cats inhabit desert areas in the [Najaf] Najaf , [Muthanna] Muthanna and [Al Anbar Governorates] Al Anbar Governorates . In Iran, it occurs in arid flat plains and sandy desert of [Abbas'abad] Abbas'abad Wildlife Reserve, [Kavir National Park] Kavir National Park and [Petergan Rural District] Petergan Rural District . Between March 2014 and July 2016, sand cats were also observed at elevations of 900–1,100 m (3,000–3,600 ft) in [Sistan and Baluchestan Province] Sistan and Baluchestan Province , foremost in [black saxaul] black saxaul dominated habitat. In central Iran, sand cats were observed foremost in sand dunes and sabulous areas during surveys in 2014–2016. 
In Pakistan, the first sand cat was detected in 1966 near the [Lora River] Lora River in [Balochistan] Balochistan . In the late 1960s, sand cats were also encountered in the [Chagai Hills] Chagai Hills , an extremely arid area comprising rolling sand dunes and stony plains at an elevation of about 1,200 m (3,900 ft). 
In Central Asia, the sand cat was known to occur up to the late 1960s in the [Karakum Desert] Karakum Desert from the [Ustyurt Plateau] Ustyurt Plateau in the northwest to the [Kopet Dag] Kopet Dag Mountains in the south, and from the [Kyzylkum Desert] Kyzylkum Desert to the [Syr Darya] Syr Darya River and the northern border to [Afghanistan] Afghanistan . Adult sand cats with kittens were photographed in the southern Kyzylkum Desert in spring 2013 and 2014. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
The sand cat is solitary, except during the [mating season] mating season and when a female has kittens. It makes loud, high-pitched and short rasping sounds, especially when seeking a mate. Its vocalizations are similar to those of the domestic cat. It communicates by [urine spraying] urine spraying and using [scent] scent and scratch marks. It buries its [feces] feces and covers it with sand. 
Its way of moving is distinct: with its belly close to the ground, it moves at a fast run punctuated with occasional leaps. It is capable of sudden bursts of speed and can sprint at speeds of 30–40 km (19–25 mi) per hour. Four radio-collared sand cats in Israel moved long distances of 5–10 km (3.1–6.2 mi) in a single night. They were generally active throughout the night, hunting and travelling an average distance of 5.4 km (3.4 mi). They retired below ground at dawn and stayed in the burrow during the day. During the survey period, they used several burrows in their home ranges. 
Burrows are about 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) deep and dug in slightly slanting ground with usually only a single entrance, though burrows with two or three entrances have also been observed. These burrows were either abandoned by [foxes] foxes or [porcupines] porcupines , or dug by [gerbils] gerbils or other rodents. In winter, sand cats stay in the sun during the day, but during the hot season, they are [crepuscular] crepuscular and [nocturnal] nocturnal . 
A male sand cat in Israel had a home range of 16 km (6.2 sq mi). In Morocco, a male sand cat travelled 14.1 km (8.8 mi) in 30 hours. A female sand cat moved in an area of 13.4 km (5.2 sq mi) during six days, and two males had home ranges of 21.8 and 35.3 km (8.4 and 13.6 sq mi). In 2018, several sand cats were observed resting in [brown-necked raven] brown-necked raven nests built in [umbrella thorn acacia] umbrella thorn acacia trees in the Moroccan Sahara. 
=== Hunting and diet ===
In the [Ténéré] Ténéré , a desert region in south central Sahara, sand cats were observed preying foremost on small [rodents] rodents , and the young of [cape hare] cape hare ( Lepus capensis Lepus capensis ), but also hunting [greater hoopoe lark] greater hoopoe lark ( Alaemon alaudipes Alaemon alaudipes ), [desert monitor] desert monitor ( Varanus griseus Varanus griseus ), sandfish ( Scincus scincus [Scincus scincus] Scincus scincus ) and venomous [Cerastesvipers] Cerastes Cerastes vipers . If they caught more than they could eat, they buried the remains for later consumption. They satisfied their moisture requirements from their prey but drank water if it was available. The [Toubou people] Toubou people have reported incidents of sand cats coming to their camps at night and drinking fresh [camel milk] camel milk . 
In Israel, remains of Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards ( Uromastyx aegyptia [Uromastyx aegyptia] Uromastyx aegyptia ) were found near burrows used by sand cats. They were observed preying on jirds [(Meriones)] ( Meriones Meriones ) , [Cairo spiny mouse] Cairo spiny mouse ( Acomys cahirinus Acomys cahirinus ), [desert lark] desert lark ( Ammomanes deserti Ammomanes deserti ) and small reptiles. In central Iran, remains of [Blanford's jerboa] Blanford's jerboa ( Jaculus blanfordi Jaculus blanfordi ) and [Balochistan gerbil] Balochistan gerbil ( Gerbillus nanus Gerbillus nanus ) were the most frequent prey species found around dens of sand cats. 
Sand cats were collected in eastern Karakum Desert in the late 1950s. Their feces and [stomachs] stomachs contained remains of [tolai hare] tolai hare ( Lepus tolai Lepus tolai ), small rodents, birds, small reptiles and [invertebrates] invertebrates . In March 2018, a sand cat was recorded feeding on a [MacQueen's bustard] MacQueen's bustard ( Chlamydotis macqueenii Chlamydotis macqueenii ) in the Kyzylkum Desert. 
=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
[Oestrus] Oestrus in female sand cats lasts from five to six days, during which they frequently call and scent mark. After a [gestation] gestation of 59 to 66 days, they give birth to a litter of two to three kittens. The kittens weigh 39 to 80 g (1.4 to 2.8 oz) at birth, and have spotted pale yellow or reddish fur. They grow relatively rapidly, reaching three quarters of the adult size within five months, are fully independent by the end of their first year and reach sexual maturity soon after the first year. In some areas, sand cats give birth to two litters per year. 
Of 228 sand cats born in zoos globally by 2007, only 61% of the kittens lived to day 30. They died primarily due to maternal neglect by first-time mothers. Otherwise, they can live up to 13 years in captivity. The life expectancy of wild sand cats has not been documented. 
The [generation length] generation length of the sand cat is about 4 years and 9 months. 
== Threats ==
[Habitat degradation] Habitat degradation and loss of sand dunes due to human activities are considered major threats to sand cat populations in [Western Asia] Western Asia , where uncontrolled hunting and persecution of predators using poisoned baits are common practices. The sand cat's small-mammal prey-base depends on having adequate vegetation, which may experience large fluctuations due to [drought] drought or declines due to [desertification] desertification and loss of natural vegetation. Fencing of protected areas threatens the sand cat in Saudi Arabia, where several individuals were found stuck in fences. In Iran, vulnerable arid ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by human settlement and activity, especially livestock grazing. In Uzbekistan, drifting sand areas are increasing, as local people uproot shrubs for use as firewood and as a substrate for silk worm ( Bombyx mori [Bombyx mori] Bombyx mori ) cocoons. 
In the Sahara, sand cats have been killed in traps laid out by inhabitants of [oases] oases targeting [foxes] foxes and [golden jackals] golden jackals ( Canis aureus Canis aureus ) or in retaliation for killing [poultry] poultry . Several cases of sand cats having been killed by domestic [dogs] dogs ( C. familiaris C. familiaris ) were reported in Israel and Iran. In Israel, the sand cat was thought to be threatened by [predation] predation from [caracals] caracals ( Caracal caracal Caracal caracal ) and [wolves] wolves ( Canis lupus Canis lupus ). 
Sand cats have also been caught for the [pet trade] pet trade in the United Arab Emirates and in Iraq. In [Baghdad] Baghdad , two sand cats were presented to a local nursery in 2012 that had been sold as pets; they died a week later. In 2014 and 2015, four sand cats were trapped alive by local truffle collectors and offered for sale in a wildlife market in Baghdad; their fate is unknown. 
Sand cats may be at risk of transfer of diseases from domestic and [feral cats] feral cats encroaching on desert areas. In Saudi Arabia, one of 17 wild-caught sand cats was tested positive for [feline leukaemia virus] feline leukaemia virus . 
== Conservation ==
Felis margarita Felis margarita is listed on [CITES Appendix II] CITES Appendix II . Hunting is prohibited in Algeria, Iran, Israel, [Kazakhstan] Kazakhstan , Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan, and Tunisia. No legal protection exists in Egypt, Mali, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Previously having been classified as [near threatened] near threatened , it has been downlisted to [least concern] least concern in 2016, as the estimated size of the global population exceeds the threshold for a threatened category; the extent of decline of the global population is unknown. 
The [Jerusalem Biblical Zoo] Jerusalem Biblical Zoo started a sand cat reintroduction project in Israel's Arabah Desert. Several captive-born individuals from the zoo's population were kept in an acclimatization enclosure, but did not survive subsequent release into the wild. 
=== In captivity ===
Since the mid 1960s, sand cats were captured in Pakistan for trade and export to Europe until the Pakistani government ceased issuing permits in 1974. Captive sand cats are highly sensitive to respiratory diseases and infection of the upper [respiratory tract] respiratory tract . This is the main cause of death in adults. The most common disease is infectious [rhinotracheitis] rhinotracheitis . With sand cats being very susceptible to [respiratory] respiratory infections, they have to be kept in very arid enclosures, where humidity and temperature do not fluctuate. 
The captive population kept in the [European Endangered Species Programme] European Endangered Species Programme is offspring of 18 founders that originated almost exclusively on the Arabian Peninsula. Until December 2009, the global captive population comprised 200 individuals in 45 institutions, including 23 European zoos with 102 individuals. The captive population within the [Species Survival Plan] Species Survival Plan for sand cat is based on eight founders. 
In 2010, two sand cat kittens were born at the [Al Ain Zoo] Al Ain Zoo after the first procedure of [in vitro fertilisation] in vitro fertilisation and [transfer] transfer of frozen-thawed [embryos] embryos into the [oviducts] oviducts of [ovulating] ovulating females. In July 2012, four sand cat kittens were born at the [Ramat Gan Zoo] Ramat Gan Zoo as part of the European Endangered Species Programme.

Ribbon-tailed Astrapia,Ribbon-tailed astrapia,"
The ribbon-tailed astrapia ribbon-tailed astrapia , also known as Shaw Mayer's astrapia Shaw Mayer's astrapia ( Astrapia mayeri Astrapia mayeri Astrapia mayeri ), is a species of [bird-of-paradise] bird-of-paradise .
The ribbon-tailed astrapia is distributed and [endemic] endemic to [subalpine] subalpine forests in western part of the central highlands of [Papua New Guinea] Papua New Guinea . Like many other ornamental birds-of-paradise, the male is [polygamous] polygamous . The ribbon-tailed astrapia is the most recently discovered bird-of-paradise.
The ribbon-tailed astrapia is listed as Least Concern on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of [CITES] CITES . The long tails of male birds add to the threat, being as though the tail makes it difficult for the species to escape from natural predators.
The scientific name commemorates the great [naturalist] naturalist and [New Guinea] New Guinea explorer [Fred Shaw Mayer] Fred Shaw Mayer , who was believed to have discovered the bird in 1938. However, it is now believed that explorer [Jack Hides] Jack Hides discovered the bird, while Mayer became interested in it later. 
== Description ==
The ribbon-tailed astrapia is medium-sized, up to 32 cm long (without including the tail of the male, which can be over 1 metre). Male ribbon-tailed astrapia are generally around 125 cm whereas females are around 35 cm. The body of males are velvet black. The male has an [iridescent] iridescent olive green and bronze [plumage] plumage , and is adorned with ornamental ""ball"" plume above its [bill] bill and two extremely long, ribbon-like white tail feathers. The female has a much duller brown and black body with an [iridescent] iridescent head. Unlike males, females do not have the long white tails. Hybrids between this species and the [Princess Stephanie's astrapia] Princess Stephanie's astrapia , in the small area where their ranges overlap, have been named [Barnes's astrapia] Barnes's astrapia .
One of the most spectacular [birds-of-paradise] birds-of-paradise , the male ribbon-tailed astrapia has the longest tail feathers in relation to body size of any bird, over three times the length of its body.

White-faced Saki,White-faced saki,"
The white-faced saki white-faced saki ( Pithecia pithecia Pithecia pithecia Pithecia pithecia ), called the Guianan saki Guianan saki and the golden-faced saki golden-faced saki , is a species of the New World [saki monkey] saki monkey . They can be found in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela. This species lives in the understory and lower canopy of the forest, feeding mostly on fruits, nuts, seeds, and insects. Although they are [arboreal] arboreal creatures and are specialists of swinging from tree to tree ( [brachiation] brachiation ), they are also terrestrial when foraging. White-faced sakis typically live around 14 years in their natural habitat and have been recorded to live up to 36 years in captivity. Sakis are active in the day and sleep highly elevated (15-20m) in trees with many leaves to shelter them from weather and flying predators. 
A formerly recognized subspecies of this monkey, P. p. chrysocephala P. p. chrysocephala , was elevated to full species status as P. chrysocephala [P. chrysocephala] P. chrysocephala in 2014. 
== Reproduction and sexual dimorphism ==
In captivity, female white-faced sakis experience ovarian cycles of approximately 17 days, and a gestational period of 20–21 weeks. Following birth, the mother undergoes a period of lactationally-induced infertility lasting 23 weeks, on average. White faced sakis breed once a year (in the spring) and only have one offspring. 
White-faced sakis display noticeable sexual dimorphism in their coloration and also in size. Females have shorter hair than males, with brownish-grey fur and white or pale brown stripes around the corners of the nose and mouth. Males, on the other hand, have blacker fur, with a reddish-white forehead, face, and throat. Their faces are much whiter than females and males are larger in body size. Males are approximately 500 grams heavier than females. Young saki males are often identified as females because of their sometimes ""grizzling"" dorsal hair and orangish bellies and it is approximately 2 months of age when males and females being to show differences, although it gradually becomes obvious over a few years. 
== Behavior ==
A pair often mates for life, and they are very devoted to one another. They will strengthen their bond by grooming one another. Male saki monkeys are usually more active than females.
They are considered monogamous, but have seldom been observed over a long period of time and many primatologists question their behavior as being ""typical monogamy"" because of their inconsistent group numbers and possible seasonal effect on congregations. A South American study performed by Shawn M. Lehman shows that their group number can range from 2-12 group members, with higher numbers typically occurring (but not exclusively) in Guyana, South America. But most widespread observations conclude that they travel in small groups of 2 and 3 which usually include the bonded parents and the offspring; they travel approximately 0.5 to 1.25 miles in search of food or other resources during the early morning and day, when they are most active. 
== Locomotion ==
White faced sakis vary from many other primates including their close relative, Chiropotes satanas [Chiropotes satanas] Chiropotes satanas , in that they are predominantly leapers, which is how they travel approximately 70 percent of the time. The other 30 percent is spent [quadrupedal] quadrupedal walking and running (25 percent) and climbing (less than 5 percent). 
== Diet ==
These primates travel longer distances than many other primates and can be picky about their sources of food; they prefer trees that produce high amounts of fruit, Capparis trees, and trees with water holes. Sakis have a mixed diet of seeds, fruits, leaves, honey, flowers, insects, and small mammals and birds and typically ingest seeds and plants that are high in lipid composition. They have also been observed crawling into hollow portions of trees and eating bats where they roost. They are capable of doing so due to their large canine teeth which assist in cracking the hard outer covering of shells and nuts. 
== Predation ==
If a predator is near, alarm calls, which have been observed to last from 1.2 to 88 minutes, will be sounded by an initial saki and then continually echoed by others to spread the warning. They will then puff their bodies up and stomp their feet on the ground or trees in an attempt to intimidate the threat. They are small primates and dwell in the branches of trees, so one of their biggest predator threats are large birds such as hawks, vultures, and the [harpy eagle] harpy eagle . In the face of danger, white faced sakis will emit warning calls to others or freeze if in the canopy in an attempt to move down where they are out of sight. The predator response of the sakis are due to what type of threat they are facing: if a smaller, easily overpowered threat, the group will participate in a behavior called ""mobbing"" to scare the predator away, but if the threat is larger, such as an eagle, they will refrain from warning calls and descend out of sight into the lower canopy. Other terrestrial and aquatic predators include the [tayra] tayra , [jaguars] jaguars , [pumas] pumas , green anacondas, [ocelots] ocelots , [red-tailed boa] red-tailed boa , and even large [mustelids] mustelids , which are usually threats to the young and elderly.

Gerenuk,Gerenuk,"
The gerenuk gerenuk ( Litocranius walleri Litocranius walleri Litocranius walleri ), also known as the giraffe gazelle giraffe gazelle , is a long-necked, medium-sized [antelope] antelope found in parts of [East Africa] East Africa . The [sole member] sole member of the [genus] genus  Litocranius Litocranius Litocranius , the gerenuk was first [described] described by the naturalist [Victor Brooke] Victor Brooke in 1879. It is characterised by its long, slender neck and limbs. The antelope is 80–105 centimetres (2 feet 7 inches – 3 feet 5 inches) tall, and weighs between 18 and 52 kilograms (40 and 115 pounds). Two types of colouration are clearly visible on the smooth [coat] coat : the reddish brown back or the ""saddle"", and the lighter flanks, fawn to buff. The [horns] horns , present only on males, are lyre-shaped.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The gerenuk was first [described] described by [Victor Brooke] Victor Brooke in 1879 on the basis of three male [specimens] specimens procured on ""the mainland of Africa, north of the island of Zanzibar"". Brooke used the [scientific name] scientific name  Gazella walleri Gazella walleri , on the request of Gerald Waller (who provided the specimens) to name it after his deceased brother. The [type locality] type locality was later corrected by [John Kirk] John Kirk , who originally obtained the specimens on the ""coast near the [River Juba] River Juba in southern [Somalia] Somalia "" before giving them to Waller. In 1886, [Franz Friedrich Kohl] Franz Friedrich Kohl proposed a new genus for the gerenuk, Litocranius Litocranius . The common name derives from the [Somali] Somali name for the animal ( gáránúug gáránúug ); the first recorded use of the name dates back to 1895. It is also known as the ""giraffe gazelle"" due to its similarity to the [giraffe] giraffe . 
Two [subspecies] subspecies have been proposed, but these are considered to be independent species by some authors. 
In 1997 [Colin Groves] Colin Groves proposed that Litocranius Litocranius is a sister [taxon] taxon of the similarly long-necked [dibatag] dibatag ( Ammodorcas clarkei Ammodorcas clarkei ), but withdrew from this in 2000. A 1999 [phylogenetic] phylogenetic study based on [cytochrome b] cytochrome b and [cytochrome c oxidase subunit III] cytochrome c oxidase subunit III analysis showed that the [tribe] tribe  [Antilopini] Antilopini , to which the gerenuk belongs, is [monophyletic] monophyletic . In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann and colleagues (of the [University of Cambridge] University of Cambridge ) revised the phylogeny of tribe on the basis of [nuclear] nuclear and [mitochondrial] mitochondrial gene analysis. The [cladogram] cladogram prepared by them (given below) showed that the [springbok] springbok ( Antidorcas marsupialis Antidorcas marsupialis ) forms a [clade] clade with the gerenuk; this clade is sister to the [saiga] saiga ( Saiga tatarica Saiga tatarica , tribe [Saigini] Saigini ) and the genera Antilope Antilope ( [blackbuck] blackbuck ), Eudorcas [Eudorcas] Eudorcas , Gazella [Gazella] Gazella and Nanger [Nanger] Nanger (of Antilopini).

== Description ==
The gerenuk is a notably tall, slender [antelope] antelope that resembles [gazelles] gazelles . It is characterised by its long, slender neck and limbs, the flat, wedge-like head and the large, round eyes. Males are nearly 89–105 cm (35– 41 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 in) tall, and the shorter females 80–100 cm (31–39 in); the head-and-body length is typically between 140 and 160 cm (55 and 63 in). Males weigh between 31 and 52 kg (68 and 115 lb); females are lighter, weighing 28–45 kg (62–99 lb). The species is [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic . The tail, that ends in a black tuft, measures 25–35 cm (10–14 in). 
Two types of colouration are clearly visible on the smooth [coat] coat : the reddish brown [dorsal] dorsal parts (the back or the ""saddle""), and the lighter flanks, fawn to buff. The underbelly and insides of the legs are cream in colour. The eyes and the mouth are surrounded by white fur. Females have a dark patch on the [crown] crown . The [horns] horns , present only on males, are lyre-like (S-shaped). Curving backward then slightly forward, these measure 25–44 cm (10– 17 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 in). 
The gerenuk resembles the [dibatag] dibatag , with which it is [sympatric] sympatric in eastern and central Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia. Both are [brachyodonts] brachyodonts and share several facial and [cranial] cranial features, along with a two-tone colouration of the coat and strong thick horns (only in males). However, there are also some features distinguishing it from the gerenuk, including major morphological differences in horns, horn cores, tail, [postorbital] postorbital area and [basioccipital] basioccipital processes. The gerenuk has a longer, heavier neck and a shorter tail. A finer point of difference is the absence of an inward-curving lobe in the lower edge of the ear (near its tip) in the gerenuk. The subspecies of the gerenuk are similar in colouration; the southern gerenuk is the smaller of the two. The Gerenuk stages of growth have a timespan from 4 months to 2.5 years: at four months, their shoulder height is about two-thirds of adult female, at six months their shoulder height is about three-quarters of adult female, at eight months their horn tips are clearly visible (about 1cm long), at one year their shoulder height is nearly equal to adult female but body more lightly built, their horns are slightly less than half ear-length, then curve, at two years their horns are about 1.5 times their ear length and the second curve becomes noticeable with the tips turning forwards, and finally at two and a half years the double curve in the horns are nearly completed. 
== Ecology and behavior ==
The gerenuk is a [diurnal] diurnal animal (active mainly during the day), though it typically stands or rests in shade during the noon. Foraging and feeding is the major activity throughout the day; females appear to spend longer time in feeding. The gerenuk may expose itself to rain, probably to cool its body. The social structure consists of small herds of two to six members. Herds typically comprise members of a single sex, though female herds additionally have juveniles. Some males lead a solitary life. 
Fighting and travel are uncommon, possibly as a strategy to save energy for foraging. Both sexes maintain [home ranges] home ranges  3–6 km (1– 2 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 sq mi) large, and might overlap. Those of males are scent-marked with [preorbital gland] preorbital gland secretions and guarded - hence these may be termed [territories] territories . The sedentary tendency of the antelope appears to increase with age. 
== Diet ==
Primarily a [browser] browser , the gerenuk feed on foliage of bushes as well as trees, shoots, herbs, flowers and fruits. It can reach higher branches and twigs better than other gazelles and antelopes by standing erect on its hindlegs and elongating its neck; this helps it reach over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) above the ground.  Acacia [Acacia] Acacia species are eaten whenever available, while evergreen vegetation forms the diet during droughts. The pointed mouth assists in extracting leaves from thorny vegetation. The gerenuk does not drink water regularly. Major predators of the antelope include [African wild dogs] African wild dogs , [cheetahs] cheetahs , [hyenas] hyenas , [lions] lions and [leopards] leopards . 
== Reproduction ==
Gerenuk reproduce throughout the year. Females reach [sexual maturity] sexual maturity at around one year, and males reach sexual maturity at 1.5 years, although in the wild they may only be successful after acquiring a territory (perhaps 3.5 years). The [gestation period] gestation period is about seven months. They are born one at a time, weighing about 3 kg (7 lb) at birth. Offspring were produced through [artificial insemination] artificial insemination for the first time in 2010 at [White Oak Conservation] White Oak Conservation in [Yulee, Florida] Yulee, Florida . Four female calves were born, and one of the four was later inseminated successfully by White Oak and SEZARC (South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction & Conservation), creating a second generation of calves born from artificial insemination. Gerenuk can live thirteen years or more in captivity, and at least eight years in the wild.

Golden Poison Frog,Golden poison frog,"
The golden poison frog golden poison frog ( Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis ), also known as the golden dart frog golden dart frog or golden poison arrow frog golden poison arrow frog , is a [poison dart frog] poison dart frog  [endemic] endemic from the rainforests of [Colombia] Colombia . The golden poison frog has become endangered due to [habitat destruction] habitat destruction within its naturally limited range. Despite its small size, this frog is considered to be the most poisonous extant animal species on the planet.
== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The golden poison frog was described as Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis in 1978 by herpetologists Charles W. Myers and Borys Malkin as well as biochemist John W. Daly; the species name terribilis terribilis is a reference to the deadly toxins present in the skin secretions of this species. Myers' research was based on hundreds of specimens collected on an expedition to the Quebrada Guangui and La Brea regions of the Colombian rainforest, and a breeding colony of 18 frogs established at the [American Museum of Natural History] American Museum of Natural History . 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The golden poison frog is [endemic] endemic to humid forests of the Pacific coast of [Colombia] Colombia in the [Cauca] Cauca and [Valle del Cauca Departments] Valle del Cauca Departments in the Chocó Rainforest. The optimal habitat of this species is the [rainforest] rainforest with high rain rates (5 m or more per year), altitudes from sea level to 200 m elevation, temperatures of at least 26 °C, and relative humidity of 80–90%. It is known only from primary forest. The eggs are laid on the ground; the males transport the [tadpoles] tadpoles to permanent pools. Its range is less than 5,000 square km; destruction of this habitat has contributed to P. terribilis P. terribilis becoming an endangered species. 
== Description ==
The golden poison frog is the largest species of the [poison dart frog] poison dart frog family, and can reach a weight of nearly 30 grams with a length of 6 cm as adults. Females are typically larger than males. The adults are brightly colored, while juvenile frogs have mostly black bodies with two golden-yellow stripes along their backs. The black fades as they mature, and at around 18 weeks of age the frog is fully colored. The frog's color pattern is [aposematic] aposematic (a coloration to warn predators of its toxicity). Despite their common name, golden poison frogs occur in four main color varieties or morphs: 
=== Yellow ===
The yellow morph is the reason Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis has the common name golden poison frog. These frogs can be pale yellow to deep, golden yellow in color. Yellow Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis specimens are found in Quebrada Guangui, Colombia. 
=== Mint green ===
The largest morph of Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis exists in the La Brea and La Sirpa areas in Colombia; despite the name ""mint green"" these frogs can be metallic green, pale green, or white. 
=== Orange ===
Orange examples of Phyllobates terribilis Phyllobates terribilis exist in Colombia, as well. They tend to be a metallic orange or yellow-orange in color, with varying intensity. They have been observed living near yellow specimens in Quebrada Guangui, Colombia, and it is unclear to what extent these represent an individual subpopulation or locality distinct from the yellow morph. 
=== Orange blackfoot ===
The orange blackfoot morph is a captive bred line established by Tesoros de Colombia, a Colombian company that aims to reduce poaching of wild dart frogs by breeding rare species and flooding the pet trade with low cost animals to decrease the value of wild specimens to poachers. This morph is golden yellow to a deep orange. They have dark markings on their feet, throat, vent, and rump that range from distinct black to nearly absent or speckled grey.
== Ecology and behavior ==
The frog is normally [diurnal] diurnal ; golden poison frogs live evenly spaced without forming larger congregations. 
=== Diet ===
This species is an unspecialized ambush hunter; an adult frog can eat food items much larger in relation to its size than most other dendrobatids. The main natural sources of food of P. terribilis P. terribilis are the ants in the genera Brachymyrmex [Brachymyrmex] Brachymyrmex and Paratrechina [Paratrechina] Paratrechina , but many kinds of insects and other small [invertebrates] invertebrates can be eaten, specifically [termites] termites and [beetles] beetles , which can easily be found on the rainforest floor. Tadpoles feed on algae, mosquito larvae, and other edible material that may be present in their environment. 
=== Breeding ===
Males advertise to receptive females with a trilling call. Golden poison frogs are notable for demonstrating tactile courtship during [reproduction] reproduction , each partner stroking its mate's head, back, flanks, and cloacal areas prior to egg deposition. The eggs are fertilized externally. The golden poison frogs lay their eggs on the ground, hidden beneath [leaf litter] leaf litter . Once the tadpoles emerge from their eggs, they stick themselves to the mucus on the backs of their parents. The adult frogs carry their young into the canopy, depositing them in the pools of water that accumulate in the centre of [bromeliads] bromeliads and water-filled tree holes. The tadpoles feed on algae and mosquito larvae in their nursery.
=== Predators ===
Golden poison frogs are so toxic that adult frogs likely have few – if any – predators. The snake species Leimadophis epinephelus [Leimadophis epinephelus] Leimadophis epinephelus has shown resistance to several frog toxins including batrachotoxin, and has been observed to eat juvenile frogs without ill effects. 
== Toxicity ==
The golden poison frog is one of the most poisonous animals on the planet; these frogs produce deadly alkaloid [batrachotoxins] batrachotoxins in their skin glands as a defense against predators. To become poisoned a predator generally must attempt to consume the frog, although this species is so toxic that even touching an individual frog can be dangerous. This extraordinarily lethal poison is very rare. Batrachotoxin is found only in three poisonous frogs from [Colombia] Colombia (all genus Phyllobates [Phyllobates] Phyllobates ), a few [birds] birds from [Papua New Guinea] Papua New Guinea , and four Papuan beetles of the genus Choresine [Choresine] Choresine in the family [Melyridae] Melyridae . Batrachotoxin affects the [sodium channels] sodium channels of nerve cells. While it is unknown how the frog avoids poisoning itself, other species of poisonous frogs have been demonstrated to express a ""toxin sponge"" protein in blood plasma, internal organs, and muscle that binds and sequesters the toxin so as to prevent autointoxication. 
=== Mechanism ===
Batrachotoxin binds to, and irreversibly opens, the [sodium channels] sodium channels of nerve cells leaving the [muscles] muscles in an inactive state of contraction, which can lead to paralysis, [heart fibrillation] heart fibrillation , [heart failure] heart failure , and death. The average dose carried will vary between locations, and consequent local diet, but the average wild golden poison frog is generally estimated to contain about one [milligram] milligram of poison, enough to kill between 10 and 20 humans, or up to two African bull elephants. Smaller doses have been shown to cause [seizures] seizures , [salivation] salivation , [muscle contractions] muscle contractions , [dyspnoea] dyspnoea and death in mice: the subcutaneous LD50 is just 0.2 μg/kg, although low doses such as 0.01 μg/kg and 0.02 μg/kg may be lethal. Myers et al. et al. estimate that the lethal dose for humans is between 2.0 and 7.5 μg.
=== Synthesis ===
Golden poison frogs appear to rely on the consumption of small [insects] insects or other [arthropods] arthropods to synthesize batrachotoxin; frogs kept in captivity fed on commercially available feeder insects will eventually lose their toxicity, and frogs bred in captivity are considered non-toxic. It is not clear which prey species supplies the potent alkaloid that gives golden poison frogs their exceptionally high levels of toxicity, or whether the frogs modify another available toxin to produce a more efficient variant, as do some of the frogs from the genus Dendrobates [Dendrobates] Dendrobates . Scientists have suggested the crucial prey item may be a small [beetle] beetle from the family [Melyridae] Melyridae . At least one species of these beetles produces the same toxin found in golden poison frogs. Their relatives in Colombian rainforests could be the source of the batrachotoxins found in the highly toxic Phyllobates Phyllobates frogs of that region. 
=== Use by indigenous people ===
Golden poison frogs are a very important frog to the local indigenous cultures, such as the [Emberá] Emberá and [Cofán] Cofán people in Colombia's rainforest. The frog is the main source of the poison in the darts used by the natives to hunt their food. The Emberá people carefully expose the frog to the heat of a fire, and the frog exudes small amounts of poisonous fluid.  The tips of arrows and darts are soaked in the fluid, and remain deadly for two years or longer. 
== In captivity ==
The golden poison frog is a popular [vivarium] vivarium subject due to its bright color and bold personality in captivity. Despite its dangerous toxicity in the wild, captive specimens raised without their natural food sources are non-toxic in captivity. Due to their small range in the wild, poaching for the pet trade formerly represented a serious threat to the survival of the species. Due to efforts of frog breeders like Tesoros de Colombia, captive bred frogs are now widely available for the pet trade. As these specimens are legal, non-toxic, healthier, and less expensive when compared to poached animals, the demand for illegally obtained wild caught specimens has decreased. Today, the [IUCN] IUCN estimates that the majority of golden poison frogs sold for the pet trade are legally produced from captive lines, and estimates the threat from collection for the pet trade to be small.

Blue-footed Booby,Blue-footed booby,"
The blue-footed booby blue-footed booby ( Sula nebouxii Sula nebouxii Sula nebouxii ) is a [marine bird] marine bird native to subtropical and tropical regions of the eastern [Pacific Ocean] Pacific Ocean . It is one of six species of the genus Sula [Sula] Sula – known as boobies. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is a [sexually selected] sexually selected trait and a product of their diet. Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by lifting them up and down while strutting before the female. The female is slightly larger than the male and can measure up to 90 cm (35 in) long with a wingspan  up to 1.5 m (5 ft). 
The natural breeding habitats of the blue-footed booby are the tropical and subtropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. It can be found from the [Gulf of California] Gulf of California south along the western coasts of Central and South America  to [Peru] Peru . About half of all breeding pairs nest on the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands . Its diet mainly consists of fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming underwater in search of its prey. It sometimes hunts alone, but usually hunts in groups. 
The blue-footed booby usually lays one to three eggs at a time. The species practices asynchronous hatching, in contrast to many other species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all chicks hatch together. This results in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings, leading to [facultative siblicide] facultative siblicide in times of food scarcity. This makes the blue-footed booby an [important model] important model for studying [parent–offspring conflict] parent–offspring conflict and [sibling rivalry] sibling rivalry .
== Taxonomy ==
The blue-footed booby was described by the French naturalist [Alphonse Milne-Edwards] Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1882 under the current [binomial name] binomial name  Sula nebouxii Sula nebouxii . The [specific epithet] specific epithet was chosen to honor the surgeon, naturalist, and explorer [Adolphe-Simon Neboux] Adolphe-Simon Neboux (1806–1844). There are two recognized [subspecies] subspecies : 
Its closest relative is the [Peruvian booby] Peruvian booby . The two species likely split from each other recently due to their shared ecological and biological characteristics. A 2011 study of multiple genes calculated the two species diverged between 1.1 and 0.8 million years ago. 
The name booby comes from the Spanish word bobo bobo (""stupid"", ""foolish"", or ""clown"") because the blue-footed booby is, like other seabirds, clumsy on land. They are also regarded as foolish for their apparent fearlessness of humans. 
== Description ==
The blue-footed booby is on average 81 cm (32 in) long and weighs .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 1.5 kg ( 3 + + 1 1 ⁄ 4 4 lb), with the female being slightly larger than the male. Its wings are long, pointed, and brown in color. The neck and head of the blue-footed booby are light brown with white streaks, while the belly and underside exhibit pure white plumage. Its eyes are placed on either side of its bill and oriented towards the front, enabling excellent [binocular vision] binocular vision . Its eyes are a distinctive yellow, with the male having more yellow in its irises than the female. Blue-footed booby chicks have black beaks and feet and are clad in a layer of soft white down. The subspecies S. n. excisa S. n. excisa that breeds on the Galápagos Islands is larger than the [nominate subspecies] nominate subspecies and has lighter plumage especially around the neck and head. 
The Peruvian booby is similar in appearance, but has grey feet, whiter head and neck, and white spots on its wing coverts. The ranges of the two species overlap in the waters of northern Peru and southern Ecuador. 
Since the blue-footed booby preys on fish by diving headlong into the water, its nostrils are permanently closed, and it has to breathe through the corners of its mouth. Its most notable characteristic is its blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a deep aquamarine. Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females. Its blue feet play a key role in courtship rituals and breeding, with the male visually displaying his feet to attract mates during the breeding season.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The blue-footed booby is distributed among the continental coasts of the eastern Pacific Ocean from [California] California to the Galápagos Islands south into Peru. It is strictly a marine bird. Its only need for land is to breed and rear young, which it does along the rocky coasts of the eastern Pacific. 
A booby may use and defend two or three nesting sites, which consist of bare black lava in small divots in the ground, until they develop a preference for one a few weeks before the eggs are laid. These nests are created as parts of large colonies. While nesting, the female turns to face the sun throughout the day, so the nest is surrounded by excrement.
=== Natal dispersal ===
Females start breeding when they are 1 to 6 years old, while males start breeding when they are 2 to 6 years old. Very limited [natal dispersal] natal dispersal occurs, meaning that young pairs do not move far from their original natal nests for their own first reproduction, leading to the congregation of hundreds of boobies in dense colonies. The benefit of limited dispersal is that by staying close to their parents' nesting sites, the boobies are more likely to have a high-quality nest. Since their parents had successfully raised chicks to reproductive age, their nest site must have been effective, either by providing cover from [predation] predation and [parasitism] parasitism , or by its suitability for taking off and landing. Bigamy has been observed in the species, and  cases are known where two females and one male all share a single nest. 
== Foot pigmentation ==
The blue color of the blue-footed booby's webbed feet comes from structures of aligned collagens in the skin modified by [carotenoid] carotenoid pigments obtained from its diet of fresh fish. The collagens are arranged in a manner that makes the skin appear blue. The underlying color is a ""flat, purplish blue"". That color is modified by carotenoids to aquamarine in healthy birds. Carotenoids also act as [antioxidants] antioxidants and stimulants for the blue-footed booby's immune function, suggesting that carotenoid pigmentation is an indicator of an individual's immunological state. Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a booby. Boobies that were experimentally food-deprived for 48 hours experienced a decrease in foot brightness due to a reduction in the amount of [lipids] lipids and [lipoproteins] lipoproteins that are used to absorb and transport carotenoids. Thus, the feet are rapid and honest indicators of a booby's current level of nourishment. As blue feet are signals that reliably indicate the immunological and health condition of a booby, coloration is favored through [sexual selection] sexual selection .
=== Female selection ===
The brightness of the feet decreases with age, so females tend to mate with younger males with brighter feet, which have higher [fertility] fertility and greater ability to provide paternal care than older males. In a [cross-fostering] cross-fostering experiment,  foot color reflects paternal contribution to raising chicks; chicks raised by foster fathers with brighter feet grew faster than chicks raised by foster males with duller feet. Females continuously evaluate their partners' condition based on foot color. In one experiment, males whose partners had laid a first egg in the nest had their feet dulled by makeup. The female partners laid smaller second eggs a few days later. As duller feet usually indicate a decrease in health and possibly genetic quality, it is adaptive for these females to decrease their investment in the second egg. The smaller second eggs contained less yolk concentration, which could influence embryo development, hatching success, and subsequent chick growth and survival. In addition, they contained less yolk [androgens] androgens . As androgen plays an important role in chick survival, the experiment suggested female blue-footed boobies use the attractiveness and perceived genetic quality of their mates to determine how much resources they should allocate to their eggs. This supports the differential allocation theory, which predicts that parents care more for their offspring when paired with attractive mates. 
=== Male selection ===
Males also assess their partner's reproductive value and adjust their investment in the brood according to their partner's condition. Females that lay larger and brighter eggs are in better condition and have greater [reproductive value] reproductive value . Therefore, males tend to display higher attentiveness and parental care to larger eggs, since those eggs were produced by a female with apparent good genetic quality. Smaller, duller eggs garnered less paternal care. Female foot color is also observed as an indication of perceived female condition. In one experiment, the color of eggs was muted by researchers,  males were willing to exercise similar care for both large eggs and small eggs if their mate had brightly colored feet, whereas males paired with dull-footed females only incubated larger eggs. Researchers also found that males did not increase their care when females exhibited both bright feet and high-quality offspring. 
== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Hunting and feeding ===
The blue-footed booby is a specialized fish eater, feeding on small schooling fish such as [sardines] sardines , [anchovies] anchovies , [mackerel] mackerel , and [flying fish] flying fish . It will also take [squid] squid and [offal] offal . The blue-footed booby hunts by diving into the ocean after prey, sometimes from a great height, and can also swim underwater in pursuit of its prey. It can hunt singly, in pairs, or in larger flocks. Boobies travel in parties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it signals to the rest of the group and they  all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like arrows. 
Plunge diving can be done from heights of 10–30.5 m (33–100 ft) and even up to 100 m (330 ft). These birds hit the water around 97 km/h (27 m/s) and can go to depths of 25 m (80 ft) below the water surface. Their skulls contain special air sacs that protect the brain from enormous pressure. Prey are usually eaten while the birds are still under water. Individuals prefer to eat on their own instead of with their hunting group, usually in the early morning or late afternoon. Males and females fish differently, which may contribute to why blue-foots, unlike other boobies, raise more than one young. The male is smaller and has a proportionally larger tail, which enables the male to fish in shallow areas and deep waters. The female is larger and can carry more food. Both the male and female feed the chicks through regurgitation. 
=== Breeding ===
The blue-footed booby is [monogamous] monogamous , although it has the potential to be bigamous. It is an [opportunistic breeder] opportunistic breeder , with the breeding cycle occurring every 8 to 9 months. The [courtship] courtship of the blue-footed booby consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and [dancing] dancing to impress the female. The male begins by showing his feet, strutting in front of the female. Then, he presents nest materials and finishes the mating ritual with a final display of his feet. The dance also includes ""sky-pointing"", which involves the male pointing his head and bill up to the sky while keeping the wings and tail raised. 
The blue-footed booby is one of only two species of booby that raises more than one chick in a breeding cycle.
The female blue-footed booby lays two or three eggs, about four to five days apart. Both male and female take turns incubating the eggs, while the nonsitting bird keeps watch. Since the blue-footed booby does not have a [brooding patch] brooding patch , it uses its feet to keep the eggs warm. The [incubation] incubation period is 41–45 days. Usually, one or two chicks are hatched from the two or three eggs originally laid. The male and female share parental [responsibilities] responsibilities . The male  provides food for the young in the first part of their lives because of his specialized diving. The female  takes over when the demand is higher. Chicks feed off the [regurgitated] regurgitated fish in the adult's mouth. If the parent blue-footed booby does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive. 
Like other [sexually size-dimorphic] sexually size-dimorphic birds, female blue-footed boobies usually favor the smaller sex during times of food scarcity. Booby chicks do not show clear differences in size based on sex, but females do grow faster than males, which means they require greater parental investment. Blue-footed boobies display behavior that is described in the flexible investment hypothesis, which states that a female adjusts the allocation of resources to maximize her lifetime reproductive success. This was shown in an experiment in which females had their flight feathers trimmed, so that they had to expend more energy during flights to obtain food for their broods. Female chicks of such mothers were more strongly affected than their brothers, in that they had lower masses and shorter wing lengths. 
Fledglings are more likely to become reproductive adults when one parent is old and the other young. The reason for this is unknown, but nestlings with different aged parents are least infected by ticks. 
The blue-footed booby lays one to three eggs in one nest at a time, although 80% of nests only contain two eggs. Eggs are laid five days apart. After the first egg is laid, it is immediately incubated, which results in a difference in chick hatching times. The first chick hatches four days before the other, so it receives a four-day head start in growth compared to its younger sibling. This [asynchronous] asynchronous hatching serves many purposes. First, it spaces out the difficult time period in [rearing] rearing during which newborn chicks are too feeble to accept [regurgitated] regurgitated food. In addition, it reduces the chance that parents will suffer total brood loss to predators such as the [milk snake] milk snake . 
Asynchronous hatching may also reduce [sibling rivalry] sibling rivalry . Experimentally manipulated synchronous broods produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in asynchronous broods were less violent. This pattern of behavior arguably occurs through a clearly established [brood hierarchy] brood hierarchy in asynchronously hatched siblings. Although asynchronous hatching is not vital for the formation of brood hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous broods established them, as well), it does aid in efficient brood reduction when food levels are low. Subordinate chicks in asynchronous broods die more quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so. 
Blue-footed booby chicks practice [facultative siblicide] facultative siblicide , opting to cause the death of a sibling based on environmental conditions. The A-chick, which hatches first, will kill the younger B-chick if  a food shortage exists. The initial size disparity between the A-chick and B-chick is retained for at least the first two months of life. During lean times, the A-chick may attack the B-chick by pecking at its younger sibling vigorously, or it may simply drag its younger sibling by the neck and oust it from the nest. Experiments in which the necks of chicks were taped to inhibit food ingestion showed that sibling aggression increased sharply when the weight of the A-chicks dropped below 20-25% of their potential. A steep increase in pecking occurred below that threshold, indicating that siblicide is, in part, triggered by the dominant chick's weight, and not simply by the size difference between the siblings. Younger broods (those less than six weeks old) had three times the rate of pecking than older broods. This is perhaps due to the relative inability of young B-chicks to defend themselves against an A-chick attack. 
The elder sibling also may harm the younger one by controlling access to the food delivered by the parents. A-chicks always receive food before B-chicks. Although subordinate chicks beg just as much as their dominant siblings, the older chicks are able to divert the parents' attention to themselves, as their large size and conspicuousness serve as more effective stimuli. 
However, another experiment showed that booby chicks do not operate exclusively by the ""leftovers hypothesis"", where younger chicks are fed only after the elder ones are completely satiated. Instead, researchers identified a certain degree of tolerance towards the younger sibling during short-term periods of food shortages. This hypothesis suggests that the elder chicks reduce food intake moderately, just enough so that the younger sibling does not starve. Although this system works during short-term food shortages, it is unsustainable during prolonged periods of dearth. In this latter case, the elder sibling usually becomes aggressive and siblicidal. 
Blue-footed booby parents are passive spectators of this intrabrood conflict. They do not intervene in their offspring's struggles, even at the point of siblicide. Booby parents even appear to facilitate the demise of the younger sibling by creating and maintaining the inequality between the two chicks. They reinforce the brood hierarchy by feeding the dominant chick more often than the subordinate one. Thus, they respond to the brood hierarchy and not to the level of [begging] begging when deciding which chick to feed, as both chicks beg in equal amounts. This level of passivity towards the very possible death of their younger offspring may be an indication that brood reduction is advantageous for the parents. The ""insurance egg hypothesis"" views the second egg and resulting chick as insurance for the parent in case the first egg does not hatch, or if food levels are higher than expected. 
However, booby parents may not be as indifferent as they seem. The parental behavior described above may be masking [parent-offspring conflict] parent-offspring conflict . Blue-footed booby parents make steep-sided nests that serve to deter the early ejection of the younger chick by the older sibling. This is in direct contrast to the [masked booby] masked booby , a species in which siblicide is obligate due to the ease in which older siblings can eject younger chicks from their flat nests. When blue-footed booby nests were experimentally flattened, parents restored them to their original steepness. Blue-footed booby chicks that were placed in masked booby nests were more likely to engage in siblicide, which reveals that parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide. Parents also appear to respond more frequently to chicks that are in poorer body conditions during periods of food deprivation. Egg-mass analysis shows that in clutches produced at the beginning of the breeding season, the second egg in a nest were, on average, 1.5% heavier than the first. Since heavier eggs give rise to heavier chicks that have greater fitness, this evidence indicates that parents may try to rectify any disadvantages that accompany a late hatching date by investing more into the second egg. Hormonal analysis of eggs also shows that  no parental favoritism seems to exist in regards to [androgen] androgen allocation. This may simply be because the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and maximize parental reproductive output. What may at first appear to be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic parent-offspring conflict. 
A dominant-subordinate relationship always exists between chicks in a brood. Although dominant A-chicks grow faster and survive past infancy more often than subordinate B-chicks, no difference in reproductive success is seen between the two types of siblings during adulthood. In one longitudinal study,  no long-term effects of dominance hierarchies were apparent; in fact, subordinate chicks were often observed producing nests of their own before their dominant siblings. 
=== Communication ===
Blue-footed boobies make raucous or polysyllabic grunts or shouts and thin whistling noises. The males of the species have been known to throw up their heads and whistle at a passing, flying female. These ritual displays are also a form of communication.
Mates can recognize each other by their calls.  Although calls differed between sexes, unique individual signatures were present. Both males and females can discriminate the calls of their mates from others. 
=== Population decline ===
Concerns of a decline in the booby population of the Galápagos Islands prompted a research project in its cause. The project, completed in April 2014, confirmed the population decline. The blue-footed booby population appears to be having trouble breeding, thus is slowly declining. The decline is feared to be long-term, but annual data collection is needed for a firm conclusion that this is not a normal fluctuation.
Food problems may be the cause of an observed failure of the birds to even try to breed. This is related to a decline in sardines ( Sardinops sagax [Sardinops sagax] Sardinops sagax ), an important part of the boobies' diet. Earlier work on [Española Island] Española Island had successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to sardines, in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of sardines. However, sardines have been largely absent from the Española area since 1997, as has been shown from [Nazca boobies] Nazca boobies there, which also prefer sardines, but can breed using other prey. In 2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies' diet were sardines. No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline, such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.

Glass Frog,Glass frog,"
The glass frogs glass frogs belong to the [amphibian] amphibian  [family] family  Centrolenidae Centrolenidae ( [order] order  [Anura] Anura ), native to the Central American Rainforests. The general background coloration of most glass frogs is primarily lime green, the abdominal skin of some members of this family is [transparent and translucent] transparent and translucent , giving the glass frog its common name. The internal [viscera] viscera , including the heart, liver, and [gastrointestinal tract] gastrointestinal tract , are visible through the skin. When active their blood makes them visible; when sleeping most of the blood is concealed in the liver, hiding them. Glass frogs are [arboreal] arboreal , living mainly in trees, feeding on small insects and only coming out for mating season. Their transparency conceals them very effectively when sleeping on a green leaf, as they habitually do. However, climate change and habitat fragmentation has been threatening the survival rates of the family.
== Taxonomy ==
The first described [species] species of Centrolenidae was the ""giant"" Centrolene geckoideum [Centrolene geckoideum] Centrolene geckoideum , named by [Marcos Jiménez de la Espada] Marcos Jiménez de la Espada in 1872, based on a specimen collected in northeastern [Ecuador] Ecuador . Several species were described in subsequent years by different herpetologists (including G. A. [Boulenger] Boulenger , G. K. Noble, and [E. H. Taylor] E. H. Taylor ), but usually placed together with the [tree frogs] tree frogs in the genera Hylella Hylella or Hyla [Hyla] Hyla .
The family Centrolenidae was proposed by [Edward H. Taylor] Edward H. Taylor in 1945. Between the 1950s and 1970s, most species of glass frogs were known from [Central America] Central America , particularly from [Costa Rica] Costa Rica and [Panama] Panama , where Taylor, Julia F., and [Jay M. Savage] Jay M. Savage extensively worked, and just a few species were known to occur in [South America] South America . In 1973, John D. Lynch and [William E. Duellman] William E. Duellman published a large revision of the glass frogs from Ecuador, showing the species richness of Centrolenidae was particularly concentrated in the [Andes] Andes . Later contributions by authors such as Juan Rivero, Savage, William Duellman, John D. Lynch, Pedro Ruiz-Carranza, and José Ayarzagüena increased the number of described taxa, especially from Central America, [Venezuela] Venezuela , [Colombia] Colombia , [Ecuador] Ecuador , and [Peru] Peru .
The evolutionary relationships, biogeography, and character evolution of centrolenidae were discussed by Guayasamin et al. (2008 ) Glass frogs originated in South America and dispersed multiple times into Central America. Character evolution seems to be complex, with multiple gains and/or losses of humeral spines, reduced hand webbing, and complete ventral transparency.
Researched by Santiago (2009) , evolution and speciation on glass frogs has shown that ecological gradient and isolation have a role in speciation and divergence in glass frogs by comparing glass frogs Mitochondrial DNA. Glass frogs have expanded from the Guiana shield to other rainforest and diversified further. They evolved to be able to survive and fit in with their 
environment.
The taxonomical classification of the glass frogs has been problematic. In 1991, after a major revision of the species and [taxonomic] taxonomic characters, the herpetologists Pedro Ruiz-Carranza and John D. Lynch published a proposal for a taxonomic classification of the Centrolenidae based on [cladistic] cladistic principles and defining [monophyletic] monophyletic groups. That paper was the first of a series of contributions dealing with the glass frogs from Colombia that led them to describe almost 50 species of glass frogs. The genus Centrolene Centrolene was proposed to include the species with a [humeral spine] humeral spine in adult males, and the genus Hyalinobatrachium [Hyalinobatrachium] Hyalinobatrachium to include the species with a bulbous liver. However, they left a heterogeneous group of species in the genus Cochranella [Cochranella] Cochranella , defined just by lacking a [humeral spine] humeral spine and a bulbous liver. Since the publication of the extensive revision of the Colombian glass frogs, several other publications have dealt with the glass frogs from Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.
In 2006, the genus Nymphargus [Nymphargus] Nymphargus was erected for the species with basal webbing among outer fingers (part of the previous Cochranella ocellata Cochranella ocellata species group).
Four genera ( Centrolene, Cochranella, Hyalinobatrachium, Nymphargus Centrolene, Cochranella, Hyalinobatrachium, Nymphargus ) have been shown to be [poly-] poly- or [paraphyletic] paraphyletic and recently a new taxonomy has been proposed (see below).
== Classification ==
The family Centrolenidae is a [clade] clade of [anurans] anurans . Previously, the family was considered closely related to the family [Hylidae] Hylidae ; however, recent [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies have placed them (and their sister [taxon] taxon , the family [Allophrynidae] Allophrynidae ) closer to the family [Leptodactylidae] Leptodactylidae .
The [monophyly] monophyly of Centrolenidae is supported by morphological and behavioral characters, including: 1) presence of a dilated process on the medial side of the third [metacarpal] metacarpal (an apparently unique [synapomorphy] synapomorphy ); 2) ventral origin of the musculus flexor teres digiti III relative to the musculus transversi metacarpi I; 3) terminal phalanges T-shaped; 4) [exotroph] exotroph , [lotic] lotic , burrower/fossorial tadpoles with a [vermiform] vermiform body and dorsal C-shaped eyes, that live buried within leaf packs in still or flowing water systems; and 5) eggs clutches deposited outside of water on vegetation or rocks above still or flowing water systems. Several molecular [synapomorphies] synapomorphies also support the monophyly of the clade. 
The taxonomic classification of the Centrolenidae was recently modified. The family now contains two subfamilies and 12 genera.

== Camouflage ==
The evolutionary advantage of a partly clear skin and an opaque back was a mystery, as it did not seem to be effective as camouflage. It was found that the colour of the frog's body changed little against darker or lighter foliage, but the legs were more translucent and consequently changed in brightness. By resting with the translucent legs surrounding the body, the frog's edge appears softer, with less brightness gradient from the leaf to the legs and from the legs to the body, making the outline less noticeable. This camouflage phenomenon, in which the frog's edges are softened to match the relative brightness of its surroundings, is referred to as edge diffusion. Herpetology researchers study the pros and cons of transparency in glass frogs, it was established that the transparency offers more than regular color changes in the skin itself through limited pigments. Experiments with computer-generated images and gelatine models of opaque and translucent frogs found that the translucent frogs were less visible, and were attacked by birds significantly less often. Photographs of the frogs were taken both at nighttime and during the day, results showed little to no visibility of the frogs on any leaves in the daytime or nighttime. It was found in 2022 that these frogs have the ability to conceal red blood cells concentrated inside their livers, increasing transparency when they are vulnerable. While this would cause massive clotting in most animals (including humans), glass frogs are able to regulate the location, density, and packing of red cells without clotting. The findings could advance medical understanding of dangerous blood clotting. 
== Characteristics ==
Glass frogs are generally small, ranging from 3–7.5 cm (1.2–3.0 in) in length. They appear light green in color over most of their bodies, except for the skin along the lower surface of the body and legs, which are transparent or translucent. The glass frog's transparent skin allows an external view of the viscera—the internal organs present in the body's main cavity—making it so observers can witness the frog's internal processes, such as the heart beating and pumping blood through its arteries. Patterning of glass frogs is varied amongst different species, while some appear as a uniform green color, others display spots that range from yellow to white, mimicking the coloration of their eggs. 
Their digit tips are expanded, allowing them to climb, thus allowing most to live in elevated areas along forest streams, such as trees and shrubs. 
Glass frogs are similar in appearance to some green frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus [Eleutherodactylus] Eleutherodactylus and to some tree frogs of the family [Hylidae] Hylidae . However, hylid tree frogs have eyes that face to the side, whilst those of glass frogs face forward.
Two members of the glass-frog family Centrolenidae: Centrolenella fleischmanni Centrolenella fleischmanni , now called Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni [Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni] Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni , and C. prosoblepon [C. prosoblepon] C. prosoblepon , and of the [hylid] hylid subfamily [Phyllomedusinae] Phyllomedusinae : [Agalychnis moreletii] Agalychnis moreletii Agalychnis moreletii and [Pachymedusa dacnicolor] Pachymedusa dacnicolor Pachymedusa dacnicolor , reflect [near-infrared light] near-infrared light (700 to 900 nanometers) when examined by infrared color photography. Infrared reflectance may confer adaptive advantage to these [arboreal] arboreal frogs both in thermoregulation and infrared [cryptic] cryptic coloration. An endangered species of glass frog found in Peru was compared to the N. mixomaculatus species and the following results were recorded: no humeral spine, no webbed fingers between II and III, finger I shorter than II, no vomerine teeth, no ulnar and tarsal tubercles or folds, no white pigment in the visceral or hepatic peritonea, and differing coloration and spots.

=== Mating ===
Mating begins by the call of a male tree frog, who is perched either on the underside or top of a leaf over a lake edge or a stream. Once a female has responded to the male's call, mating begins on the leaf in the amplexus physical position, in which the male wraps his arms around the female and attaches himself to her back. Once the physical mating process has concluded, the female produces her eggs onto the leaf before departing, leaving the male to defend the newly-laid eggs against predators. 
Centrolenidae is a species that has long-term parental care, males guard the clutch for various days after the eggs are laid. Environmental aspects also play into the amount of time the male glass frog tends to the young, such as rainfall or wind. Female post-oviposition care is most often based on body conditions, whether or not she is able to fend for herself will tell how long after her eggs are laid that she will remain by the clutch. Males will occasionally call for and mate with other females on the same leaf, establishing a multitude of different developmentally-staged egg clutches to guard.
=== Tadpoles ===
Once the tadpoles, the frog aquatic larval stage, have been hatched, they fall from their original position on the leaf into the water below. When living in the water the tadpoles feed on the [leaf litter] leaf litter and streamside detritus until undergoing metamorphosis to become a froglet. 
== Conservation ==
=== Predators ===
A main predator on the glass frog in its tadpole stage are ""frog flies"", which lay their eggs within the frog eggs; after hatching the maggots feed on the embryos of the glass frogs. 
Glass frog behaviors to avoid predation vary from species to species as well as circumstances. Hyalinobatrachium iaspidiense Hyalinobatrachium iaspidiense was observed having a flattened body posture to avoid predation, after disturbing the frog it propped up into a sitting position. Another male H. iaspidiense H. iaspidiense was observed protecting an egg clutch with a body positioning of extending all limbs and lifting its body from the leaf.
=== Protection ===
All glass frogs are protected under the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species] Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permitting system. 
== Distribution ==
The Centrolenidae are a diverse family, distributed from southern [Mexico] Mexico to [Panama] Panama , and through the Andes from [Venezuela] Venezuela and the island of [Tobago] Tobago to [Bolivia] Bolivia , with some species in the [Amazon] Amazon and [Orinoco River] Orinoco River basins, the [Guiana Shield] Guiana Shield region, southeastern [Brazil] Brazil , and northern [Argentina] Argentina .
The biggest threats they have are deforestation, invasive species, pollution, habitat loss and illegal pet trade. These many threats have led to a decline in the population of this species.
== Biology ==
Glass frogs are mostly [arboreal] arboreal . They live along rivers and streams during the breeding season, and are particularly diverse in montane [cloud forests] cloud forests of Central and South America, although some species occur also in [Amazon] Amazon and [Chocóan] Chocóan  [rainforest] rainforest and [semideciduous] semideciduous forests.
Hyalinobatrachium valerioi [Hyalinobatrachium valerioi] Hyalinobatrachium valerioi glass frogs are carnivores, their diet mainly including small insects like crickets, moths, flies, spiders, and other smaller frogs. 
The eggs are usually deposited on the leaves of trees or shrubs hanging over the running water of mountain streams, creeks, and small rivers. One species leaves its eggs over stones close to waterfalls. The method of egg-laying on the leaf varies between species. The males usually call from leaves close to their egg clutches. These eggs are less vulnerable to predators than those laid within water, but are affected by the parasitic [maggots] maggots of some fly species. Some glass frogs show parental care: in many species, glass frog females brood their eggs during the night the eggs are fertilized, which improves the survival of the eggs, while in almost a third of species, glass frog males stay on guard for much longer periods. After they hatch, the [tadpoles] tadpoles fall into the waters below. The tadpoles are elongated, with powerful tails and low fins, suited for fast-flowing water. Outside of the breeding season, some species live in the [canopy] canopy .
The majority of amphibians use cutaneous respiration, or the process of breathing through the skin. Due to the importance of the skin, amphibians are very sensitive to what goes through their permeable skin, the stratum corneum is the main skin barrier which is much thinner than other classes such as mammals or birds. Chemicals and high amounts of elements in water or rainfall may disturb frogs’ health and possibly lives.

Vampire Finch,Vampire ground finch,"
Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis 
The vampire ground finch vampire ground finch ( Geospiza septentrionalis Geospiza septentrionalis Geospiza septentrionalis ) is a small [bird] bird native to the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands . [Endemic] Endemic to [Wolf] Wolf and [Darwin Island] Darwin Island , it was previously considered a very distinct [subspecies] subspecies of the [sharp-beaked ground finch] sharp-beaked ground finch ( Geospiza difficilis Geospiza difficilis ), but the [International Ornithologists' Union] International Ornithologists' Union has split the species based on strong genetic evidence that they are not closely related, and divergences in morphology and song. 
== Description ==
The vampire finch is [sexually dimorphic] sexually dimorphic as typical for its [genus] genus , with the males being primarily black and the females grey with brown streaks. It has a lilting song on Wolf, a buzzing song on Darwin, and whistling calls on both islands; only on Wolf, a drawn-out, buzzing call is also uttered. 
== Ecology ==
This bird is most famous for its unusual diet. When alternative sources are scarce, the vampire finch occasionally feeds
by [drinking the blood] drinking the blood of other birds, chiefly the [Nazca] Nazca and [blue-footed boobies] blue-footed boobies , pecking at their skin with their sharp beaks until blood is drawn. Curiously, the boobies do not offer much resistance against this. It has been theorized that this behavior evolved from the pecking behavior that the finch used to clean [parasites] parasites from the plumage of the booby. The finches also feed on eggs, stealing them just after they are laid and rolling them (by pushing with their legs and using their beak as a pivot) into rocks until they break. Finally guano and leftover fish from other predators additionally serve as diet options. 
Vampire ground finches drink more blood during dry seasons when seeds and other prey are scarce, resuming omnivorous predation when the rainy season begins. There were also significant variations in the intestinal microbial community structure. There was a clear separation between vampire ground finches and other finches. Vampire ground finch birds have [intestinal microbial communities] intestinal microbial communities rich in [peptostreptococcacea] peptostreptococcacea . Similarly, [vampire bats] vampire bats also possess [peptostreptococcacea] peptostreptococcacea in their gut flora. 
More conventionally for birds, but still unusual among Geospiza, Geospiza, they also take [nectar] nectar from [Galápagos prickly pear] Galápagos prickly pear ( Opuntia echios Opuntia echios var. gigantea gigantea ) flowers, at least on Wolf Island. The reason for these peculiar feeding habits is the lack of [fresh water] fresh water on these birds' home islands. Nonetheless, the mainstay of their diet is made up from seeds and [invertebrates] invertebrates , as in their congeners. 
== Conservation ==
The vampire finch is classified as [vulnerable] vulnerable by the [IUCN] IUCN based on its very restricted distribution and the impact of invasive species in its habitat.

Giant Isopod,Giant isopod,"
A giant isopod giant isopod is any of the almost 20 [species] species of large [isopods] isopods in the [genus] genus  Bathynomus Bathynomus Bathynomus . They are abundant in the cold, deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.  Bathynomus giganteus [Bathynomus giganteus] Bathynomus giganteus , the species upon which the [generitype] generitype is based, is often considered the largest isopod in the world, though other comparably poorly known species of Bathynomus Bathynomus may reach a similar size (e.g., B. Kensleyi B. Kensleyi ). The giant isopods are noted for their resemblance to the much smaller common [woodlouse] woodlouse (pill bug), to which they are related. 
French zoologist [Alphonse Milne-Edwards] Alphonse Milne-Edwards was the first to describe the genus in 1879 after his colleague [Alexander Agassiz] Alexander Agassiz collected a juvenile male B. giganteus B. giganteus from the [Gulf of Mexico] Gulf of Mexico . This was an exciting discovery for both scientists and the public, as at the time the idea of a lifeless or ""azoic"" deep ocean had only recently been refuted by the work of [Sir Charles Wyville Thomson] Sir Charles Wyville Thomson and others. No females were recovered until 1891.
Giant isopods are of little interest to most [commercial fisheries] commercial fisheries , but are infamous for attacking and destroying fish caught in [trawls] trawls . Specimens caught in the Americas and Japan are sometimes seen in [public aquariums] public aquariums . 
== Description ==
Giant isopods are a good example of [deep-sea gigantism] deep-sea gigantism ( cf. cf.  [giant squid] giant squid ), as they are far larger than the ""typical"" isopods that are up to 5 cm (2.0 in). Bathynomus Bathynomus can be divided into ""giant"" species where the adults generally are between 8 and 15 cm (3.1 and 5.9 in) long and ""supergiant"" species where the adults are typically between 17 and 50 cm (6.7 and 19.7 in). One of the ""supergiants"", B. giganteus B. giganteus , reaches a typical length between 19 and 36 cm (7.5 and 14.2 in); an individual claimed to be 76 cm (30 in) long has been reported by the popular press, but the largest confirmed was c. c. 50 cm (20 in). 
Their [morphology] morphology resembles that of their terrestrial relative, the [woodlouse] woodlouse . Their bodies are dorsoventrally compressed, protected by a rigid, calcareous [exoskeleton] exoskeleton composed of overlapping segments. Like some woodlice, they can curl up into a ""ball"", where only the tough shell is exposed. This protects from predators trying to strike at the more vulnerable underside. The first shell segment is fused to the head; the most posterior segments are often fused, as well, forming a ""caudal shield"" over the shortened abdomen ( [pleon] pleon ). 
The large eyes are [compound] compound with nearly 4,000 [facets] facets , [sessile] sessile , and spaced far apart on the head. They have two pairs of [antennae] antennae . The [uniramous] uniramous  [thoracic legs] thoracic legs or pereiopods are arranged in seven pairs, the first of which is modified into [maxillipeds] maxillipeds to manipulate and bring food to the four sets of jaws. The abdomen has five segments called pleonites, each with a pair of [biramous] biramous pleopods. These are modified into swimming legs and rami, flat respiratory structures acting as [gills] gills . The isopods are a pale lilac or pinkish. 
The individual species generally resemble each other but can be separated by various morphological features, notably the number (7–13) and shape (straight or upturned) of the spines on the [pleotelson] pleotelson (""tail""), shape  (simple or [bifid] bifid ) of the central spine on the pleotelson, and the shape and structure of the [uropods] uropods and [pereopods] pereopods . 
Giant isopods like [Bathynomus giganteus] Bathynomus giganteus store substantial organic reserves in their midgut gland and fat body, with lipids forming a significant component, particularly in the fat body where [triacylglycerols] triacylglycerols make up 88% of total lipids. 
== Range ==
Giant isopods have been recorded in the West Atlantic from the US state of [Georgia] Georgia to [Brazil] Brazil , including the [Gulf of Mexico] Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The four known Atlantic species are B. obtusus B. obtusus , B. miyarei B. miyarei , B. maxeyorum B. maxeyorum , and B. giganteus B. giganteus , and the last of these is the only species recorded off the United States. The remaining Bathynomus Bathynomus species are all restricted to the [Indo-Pacific] Indo-Pacific . 
No species occur in both the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. Previous records of B. giganteus B. giganteus from the Indo-Pacific are now considered misidentifications of other species. Giant isopods are unknown from the East Atlantic or East Pacific. The greatest [species richness] species richness (five species) is found off eastern Australia, but it is possible other regions that are not as well-sampled match this figure. In general, the distributions of giant isopods are imperfectly known, and [undescribed species] undescribed species may exist. 
== Ecology ==
Giant isopods are important [scavengers] scavengers in the deep-sea [benthic environment] benthic environment . They are mainly found from the gloomy [sublittoral zone] sublittoral zone at a depth of 170 m (560 ft) to the pitch darkness of the [bathyal] bathyal zone at 2,140 m (7,020 ft), where pressures are high and temperatures are very low. A few species from this genus have been reported from shallower depths, notably B. miyarei B. miyarei between 22 and 280 m (72 and 919 ft), the poorly known B. decemspinosus B. decemspinosus between 70 and 80 m (230 and 260 ft), and B. doederleini B. doederleini as shallow as 100 m (330 ft). 
The depth record for any giant isopod is 2,500 m (8,200 ft) for B. kensleyi B. kensleyi , but this species also occurs as shallow as 300 m (980 ft). Over 80% of B. giganteus B. giganteus are found at a depth between 365 and 730 m (1,198 and 2,395 ft). In regions with both ""giant"" and ""supergiant"" species, the former mainly live on the [continental slope] continental slope , while the latter mainly live on the [bathyal plain] bathyal plain . Although Bathynomus Bathynomus have been recorded in water as warm as 20 °C (68 °F), they are primarily found in much colder places. For example, during a survey of the deep-sea fauna of [Exuma Sound] Exuma Sound in the Bahamas, B. giganteus B. giganteus was found to be common in water between 3.25 and 13 °C (37.8 and 55.4 °F), but more abundant towards the lower temperature. 
In contrast, preliminary studies indicate that B. doederleinii B. doederleinii stops feeding when the temperature falls below 3 °C (37 °F). This lower temperature limit may explain their absence from [temperate] temperate and [frigid] frigid regions where seas at the depth preferred by Bathynomus Bathynomus often are colder. They are thought to prefer a muddy or clay substrate and lead solitary lives.
Although generalist scavengers, these isopods are mostly [carnivorous] carnivorous and feed on dead whales, fish, and squid. They may also prey on slow-moving animals such as [sea cucumbers] sea cucumbers , [sponges] sponges , [radiolarians] radiolarians , [nematodes] nematodes , and other [zoobenthos] zoobenthos , and perhaps even live fish. They are known to attack trawl catches. One giant isopod was filmed attacking a larger [dogfish shark] dogfish shark in a deepwater trap by latching onto and eating its face. 
As food is scarce in the deep-ocean [biome] biome , giant isopods must take advantage of whatever food they have available. They are adapted to long periods of famine and have been known to survive over 5 years without food in captivity. When a significant source of food is encountered, giant isopods gorge themselves to the point that they could barely move. A study examining the digestive system contents of 1651 specimens of B. giganteus B. giganteus found that fish were most commonly eaten, followed by [cephalopods] cephalopods and [decapods] decapods , particularly [carideans] carideans and [galatheids] galatheids . 
Giant isopods collected along the east coast of Australia by setting traps exhibit a variation in diversity with water depth. The deeper the water, the fewer number of species found, and the larger the species tended to be. The giant isopods found in very deep waters off Australia were compared to those found off Mexico and India. From the fossil record, Bathynomus Bathynomus is thought to have existed more than 160 million years ago, so it did not evolve independently in all three locations, but since then Bathynomus Bathynomus likely would show divergent evolution in the various locations. However, the giant isopods in all three locations are almost identical in appearance (although some differences are seen, and they are separate species). This reduced [phenotypic] phenotypic divergence is linked to the extremely low light levels of their habitat. 
== Reproduction ==
A study of the seasonal abundance of B. giganteus B. giganteus juveniles and adults suggests a peak in reproductive capacity in the spring and winter. This is observed to be due to a shortage of food during the summer. Mature females develop a [brood pouch] brood pouch or marsupium when sexually active, the pouch being formed by overlapping [oostegites] oostegites or brood plates grown from the medial border of the [pereiopods] pereiopods . The young isopods emerge from the marsupium as miniatures of the adults, known as [mancae] mancae . This is not a [larval] larval stage; the mancae are fully developed, lacking only the last pair of pereiopods.
== Human consumption ==
There have been occasional attempts at utilizing giant isopods as novelty food, such as prepared in [East Asian cuisine] East Asian cuisine like [ramen] ramen . Relative to total size, there is not very much ""meat"" to be harvested. The meat is sometimes described as resembling lobster and/or crab in taste, with a somewhat firmer, chewier texture. 
== Classification ==
The genus currently contains the following species: 
== Fossilized species ==
Fossilized specimens of Bathynomus Bathynomus are known extending back to at least the Early [Oligocene] Oligocene ( [Rupelian] Rupelian ) of Italy, with other fossils being known from Japan and Spain.

Sunbittern,Sunbittern,"
The sunbittern sunbittern ( Eurypyga helias Eurypyga helias Eurypyga helias ) is a [bittern] bittern -like bird of tropical regions of the Americas, and the [sole member] sole member of the [family] family  Eurypygidae Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae Eurypigidae ) and [genus] genus  Eurypyga Eurypyga Eurypyga . It is found in Central and South America, and has three [subspecies] subspecies . The sunbittern shows both morphological and molecular similarities with the [kagu] kagu ( Rhynochetos jubatus Rhynochetos jubatus ) of [New Caledonia] New Caledonia , indicating a [Gondwanan] Gondwanan origin, both species being placed in the [clade] clade  [Eurypygiformes] Eurypygiformes . 
== Taxonomy ==
The sunbittern was traditionally placed in the [Gruiformes] Gruiformes , but this was always considered preliminary. Altogether, the bird is most similar to another bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the [kagu] kagu ( Rhynochetos jubatus Rhynochetos jubatus ). Molecular studies seem to confirm that the kagu and sunbittern are each other's closest living relatives and have a similar wing display. They are probably not Gruiformes (though the proposed [Metaves] Metaves are just as weakly supported). Altogether, the two species seem to form a minor [Gondwanan] Gondwanan lineage which could also include the extinct [adzebills] adzebills and/or the [mesites] mesites , and is of unclear relation to the Gruiformes proper. Notably, the kagu and mesites also have [powder down] powder down .
An indeterminate fossil eurypygid has been documented from the [Green River Formation] Green River Formation of [Wyoming] Wyoming , USA. This specimen, known from a full skeleton, is the oldest and only known fossil of the group, and suggests that eurypygids had a much more northernly range in the past. This specimen has been figured in several studies, and was given the unofficial name "" Eoeurypyga olsoni Eoeurypyga olsoni "" in a 2003 dissertation, but as-of-yet remains unnamed. 
=== Subspecies ===
The sunbittern was formerly treated as two species ( E. helias E. helias and E. major E. major ), but now they are treated as a single species with considerable variation between the [subspecies] subspecies . The three subspecies are recognised on the basis of plumage characters and size. The three subspecies are [allopatric] allopatric . 
== Description ==
The bird has a generally subdued coloration, with fine linear patterns of black, grey and brown. Its [remiges] remiges however have vividly colored middle webs, which with wings fully spread show bright eyespots in red, yellow, and black. These are shown to other sunbitterns in courtship and threat displays, or used to startle potential predators. Male and female adult sunbitterns can be differentiated by small differences in the feather patterns of the throat and head. Like some other birds, the sunbittern has [powder down] powder down .
The sunbittern has a long and pointed bill that is black above, and a short [hallux] hallux as in shorebirds and rails. In the South American subspecies found in lowlands east of the [Andes] Andes , the upperparts are mainly brown, and the legs and lower mandible are orange-yellow. The two other subspecies are greyer above, and their legs and bill are sometimes redder. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The sunbittern's [range] range extends from [Guatemala] Guatemala to [Brazil] Brazil . The nominate race, E. h. helias E. h. helias , is found east of the Andes in lowland tropical South America, from the [Orinoco] Orinoco basin, through the [Amazon basin] Amazon basin and [Pantanal] Pantanal . The subspecies E. h. meridionalis E. h. meridionalis , has a more restricted distribution, being found along the East Andean slope in south-central [Peru] Peru , in the lower subtropical zone at altitudes of 800–1,830 m (2,620–6,000 ft). The final subspecies, E. h. major E. h. major , is found at various altitudes ranging from southern [Guatemala] Guatemala , through Central America and the [Chocó] Chocó to western [Ecuador] Ecuador . This subspecies may also be present in southern [Mexico] Mexico . It has been traditionally reported from the Atlantic slope of [Chiapas] Chiapas , but no specimens are known and there have been no recent records. 
The species is found in the humid [Neotropical] Neotropical forests, generally with an open understorey and near rivers, streams, ponds or lagoons. 
== Behaviour and ecology ==
They are cryptic birds that display their large wings, that exhibits a pattern that resemble eyes, when they feel threatened.
=== Feeding ===
The sunbittern consumes a wide range of animal prey. Insects form an important part of the diet, with cockroaches, dragonfly larvae, flies, katydids, water beetles and moths being taken. Other invertebrate prey includes crabs, spiders, shrimps and earthworms. They will also take vertebrate prey including fish, tadpoles, toads and frogs, eels and lizards. 
Sunbitterns are one of 12 species of birds in five families that have been described as fishing using baits or lures to attract prey to within striking distance. This type of behaviour falls within the common definition of [tool use] tool use . In sunbitterns this behaviour has only been observed in captive birds so far. 
=== Breeding ===
Sunbitterns start nesting in the early wet season and before it starts they make flight displays 10–15 m (33–49 ft) high in the forest canopy. They build open nests in trees, and lay two eggs with blotched markings. The young are [precocial] precocial , but remain in the nest for several weeks after hatching.

Coconut Crab,Coconut crab,"
The coconut crab coconut crab ( Birgus latro Birgus latro ) is a [terrestrial] terrestrial  [species] species of giant [hermit crab] hermit crab , and is also known as the robber crab robber crab or palm thief palm thief . It is the largest terrestrial [arthropod] arthropod known, with a weight of up to 4.1 kg (9 lb). The distance from the tip of one leg to the tip of another can be as wide as 1 m (3 ft 3 in). It is found on islands across the [Indian] Indian and [Pacific] Pacific Oceans, as far east as the [Gambier Islands] Gambier Islands , [Pitcairn Islands] Pitcairn Islands and [Caroline Island] Caroline Island and as far west as [Zanzibar] Zanzibar . While its range broadly shadows the distribution of the [coconut palm] coconut palm , the coconut crab has been [extirpated] extirpated from most areas with a significant human population such as mainland [Australia] Australia and [Madagascar] Madagascar .
The coconut crab is the [only species] only species of the [genus] genus  Birgus Birgus Birgus , and is related to the other terrestrial hermit crabs of the genus Coenobita [Coenobita] Coenobita . It shows a number of [adaptations] adaptations to life on land. Juvenile coconut crabs use empty [gastropod shells] gastropod shells for protection like other hermit crabs, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomens and stop carrying a shell. Coconut crabs have organs known as [branchiostegal lungs] branchiostegal lungs , which they use for breathing instead of their vestigial [gills] gills . After the juvenile stage, they will drown if immersed in water for too long. They have an acute sense of smell which they use to find potential food sources, and which has developed [convergently] convergently with that of [insects] insects .
Adult coconut crabs feed primarily on fleshy fruits, nuts, seeds, and the [pith] pith of fallen trees, but they will eat [carrion] carrion and other organic matter opportunistically. Anything left unattended on the ground is a potential source of food, which they will investigate and may carry away – thereby getting the alternative name of ""robber crab"". The species is popularly associated with the coconut palm, yet coconuts are not a significant part of its diet. Although it lives in a burrow, the crab has been filmed climbing coconut and [pandanus] pandanus trees. No film shows a crab selectively picking coconut fruit, though they might dislodge ripe fruit that otherwise would fall naturally. When a crab is not near its burrow, climbing is an immediate escape route from predators. Sea birds eat young crabs, and both humans and larger, older crabs eat crabs of all ages.
Mating occurs on dry land, but the females return to the edge of the sea to release their fertilized eggs, and then retreat up the beach. The larvae that hatch are [planktonic] planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before settling to the sea floor, entering a [gastropod shell] gastropod shell and returning to dry land. [Sexual maturity] Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain at sea, their chances of reaching another suitable location is enhanced if a floating life support system avails itself to them. Examples of the systems that provide such opportunities include floating logs and rafts of marine or terrestrial vegetation. Similarly, floating coconuts can be a very significant part of the crab's dispersal options. Fossils of this crab date back to the [Miocene] Miocene . 
== Taxonomy ==
The coconut crab has been known to western scientists since the voyages of [Francis Drake] Francis Drake around 1580 and [William Dampier] William Dampier around 1688. Based on an account by [Georg Eberhard Rumphius] Georg Eberhard Rumphius (1705), who had called the animal "" Cancer crumenatus Cancer crumenatus Cancer crumenatus Cancer crumenatus "", [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus (1767) named the species Cancer latro Cancer latro , from the [Latin] Latin  latro latro latro [latro] latro , meaning ""robber"". The genus Birgus Birgus was erected in 1816 by [William Elford Leach] William Elford Leach , containing only Linnaeus' Cancer latro Cancer latro , which was thus renamed Birgus latro Birgus latro . 
Birgus Birgus is classified in the family [Coenobitidae] Coenobitidae , alongside one other genus, Coenobita [Coenobita] Coenobita , which contains terrestrial hermit crabs. 
[Common names] Common names for the species include coconut crab, robber crab, and palm thief, which mirrors the animal's name in other European languages ( e.g. e.g.  [German] German : Palmendieb Palmendieb ). In Japan (where the species lives on some of the country's southerly island chains), the species is typically referred to as yashigani yashigani ( ヤシガニ ヤシガニ ヤシガニ ) , meaning 'palm crab'. 
== Description ==
B. latro B. latro is both the largest living terrestrial [arthropod] arthropod and the largest living terrestrial invertebrate. Reports of its size vary, but most sources give a body length up to 40 cm (16 in), a weight up to 4.1 kg (9 lb), and a leg span more than 0.91 m (3 ft), with males generally being larger than females. The [carapace] carapace may reach a length of .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 78 mm ( 3 + + 1 1 ⁄ 16 16 in), and a width up to 200 mm (8 in). 
The body of the coconut crab is, like those of all [decapods] decapods , divided into a front section ( [cephalothorax] cephalothorax ) with 10 [legs] legs , and an [abdomen] abdomen . The front-most pair of legs has large [chelae] chelae (claws) with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs of legs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, powerful walking legs with pointed tips that allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or even overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller, with [tweezer] tweezer -like chelae at the end allowing young coconut crabs to grip the inside of the shell or coconut husks that juveniles habitually carry for protection. Adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held in the cavity containing the breathing organs, inside the carapace. Some difference in color occurs between individuals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue, In most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places such as the [Seychelles] Seychelles most individuals are red. 
Although B. latro B. latro is a [derived] derived type of [hermit crab] hermit crab , only juveniles use salvaged [snail] snail  [shells] shells to protect their soft abdomens while adolescents sometimes use broken coconut shells for the same purpose. Unlike other hermit crabs, the adult coconut crabs do not carry shells but instead harden their abdominal [terga] terga by depositing [chitin] chitin and [calcium carbonate] calcium carbonate . Absent the physical constraint of living within another creature's shell B. latro B. latro grows much larger than its relatives in the family Coenobitidae. Despite being the product of [carcinization] carcinization , like most [true crabs] true crabs  B. latro B. latro bends its [tail] tail beneath its body for protection. 
The hardened abdomen protects the coconut crab and reduces water loss on land, but must be periodically [moulted] moulted . Adults moult annually, digging a burrow up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long in which to hide while their soft shell hardens. Depending on the size of the individual 1–3 weeks are needed for the [exoskeleton] exoskeleton to harden. The animals remain in this burrow for 3–16 weeks, again depending on size. 
=== Respiration ===
Except as [larvae] larvae , coconut crabs cannot swim, and they drown if left in water for more than an hour. They use a special organ called a [branchiostegal lung] branchiostegal lung to breathe. This organ can be interpreted as a developmental stage between [gills] gills and [lungs] lungs , and is one of the most significant adaptations of the coconut crab to its [habitat] habitat . The branchiostegal lung contains a [tissue] tissue similar to that found in gills, but suited to the absorption of [oxygen] oxygen from air, rather than water. This organ is expanded laterally and is [evaginated] evaginated to increase the surface area; located in the cephalothorax, it is optimally placed to reduce both the blood/gas diffusion distance and the return distance of oxygenated blood to the [pericardium] pericardium . 
Coconut crabs use their hindmost, smallest pair of legs to clean these breathing organs and to moisten them with water. The organs require water to properly function, and the coconut crab provides this by stroking its wet legs over the spongy tissues nearby. Coconut crabs may drink water from small puddles by transferring it from their [chelipeds] chelipeds to their [maxillipeds] maxillipeds . 
In addition to the branchiostegal lung, the coconut crab has an additional rudimentary set of gills. Although these gills are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families [Paguridae] Paguridae and [Diogenidae] Diogenidae , they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area. 
=== Sense of smell ===
The coconut crab has a well-developed sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently depending on whether the smelled molecules are [hydrophilic] hydrophilic molecules in water or [hydrophobic] hydrophobic molecules in air. Crabs that live in water have specialized organs called [aesthetascs] aesthetascs on their [antennae] antennae to determine both the intensity and the direction of a scent. Coconut crabs live on the land, so the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and are more similar to those of [insects] insects . 
While insects and the coconut crab originate from different clades, the same need to track smells in the air led to convergent evolution of similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. Their sense of smell can detect interesting odors over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. The [olfactory system] olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain. 
== Life cycle ==
Coconut crabs mate frequently and quickly on dry land in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Males have [spermatophores] spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomens of females; the [oviducts] oviducts opens at the base of the third [pereiopods] pereiopods , and [fertilisation] fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen, as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. 
The extrusion of [eggs] eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. The female lays her eggs shortly after mating and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab migrates to the seashore and releases the [larvae] larvae into the ocean. The coconut crab takes a large risk while laying the eggs, because coconut crabs cannot swim: If a coconut crab falls into the water or is swept away, its weight makes it difficult, or impossible, for it to swim back to dry land. The egg laying usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high [tide] tide . The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days. 
The larvae float in the [pelagic zone] pelagic zone of the ocean with other [plankton] plankton for 3–4 weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The [larvae] larvae pass through three to five zoea zoea stages before moulting into the postlarval glaucothoe glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. 
Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches [sexual maturity] sexual maturity around 5 years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40–60 years. They grow remarkably slowly, and may take up to 120 years to reach full size, as posited by ecologist Michelle Drew of the Max Planck Institute. 
== Distribution ==
Coconut crabs live in the [Indian Ocean] Indian Ocean and the central [Pacific Ocean] Pacific Ocean , with a distribution that closely matches that of the [coconut palm] coconut palm . The western limit of the range of B. latro B. latro is [Zanzibar] Zanzibar , off the coast of [Tanzania] Tanzania , while the tropics [of Cancer] of Cancer and [Capricorn] Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few populations in the [subtropics] subtropics , such as the [Ryukyu Islands] Ryukyu Islands . Some evidence indicates the coconut crab once lived on the mainland of Australia, Madagascar, [Rodrigues] Rodrigues , [Easter Island] Easter Island , [Tokelau] Tokelau , the [Marquesas] Marquesas islands, and possibly [India] India , but is now [extirpated] extirpated in those areas. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae. 
[Christmas Island] Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has the largest and densest population of coconut crabs in the world, although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the [Christmas Island red crab] Christmas Island red crab ( Gecarcoidea natalis Gecarcoidea natalis ). Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the [Seychelles] Seychelles , including [Aldabra] Aldabra and [Cosmoledo] Cosmoledo , but the coconut crab is extinct on the central islands. Coconut crabs occur on several of the [Andaman] Andaman and [Nicobar Islands] Nicobar Islands in the [Bay of Bengal] Bay of Bengal . They occur on most of the islands, and the northern [atolls] atolls , of the [Chagos Archipelago] Chagos Archipelago . 
In the Pacific, the coconut crab's range became known gradually. [Charles Darwin] Charles Darwin believed it was only found on ""a single coral island north of the [Society group] Society group "". The coconut crab is far more widespread, though it is not abundant on every Pacific island it inhabits. Large populations exist on the [Cook Islands] Cook Islands , especially [Pukapuka] Pukapuka , [Suwarrow] Suwarrow , [Mangaia] Mangaia , [Takutea] Takutea , [Mauke] Mauke , [Atiu] Atiu , and [Palmerston Island] Palmerston Island . These are close to the eastern limit of its range, as are the [Line Islands] Line Islands of [Kiribati] Kiribati , where the coconut crab is especially frequent on [Teraina] Teraina (Washington Island), with its abundant coconut palm forest. The [Gambier Islands] Gambier Islands mark the species' eastern limit. 
== Ecology ==
=== Diet ===
The diet of coconut crabs consists primarily of fleshy [fruits] fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae [Ochrosia ackeringae] Ochrosia ackeringae , Arenga listeri [Arenga listeri] Arenga listeri , Pandanus elatus [Pandanus elatus] Pandanus elatus , P. christmatensis [P. christmatensis] P. christmatensis ); nuts ( Aleurites moluccanus [Aleurites moluccanus] Aleurites moluccanus ), drupes ( Cocos nucifera [Cocos nucifera] Cocos nucifera ) and seeds ( Annona reticulata [Annona reticulata] Annona reticulata ); and the [pith] pith of fallen trees. However, as they are [omnivores] omnivores , they will consume other organic materials such as [tortoise] tortoise hatchlings and dead animals, including other crustaceans, as well as the molted exoskeletons of other crustaceans. They have been observed to prey upon crabs such as Gecarcoidea natalis [Gecarcoidea natalis] Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes [Discoplax hirtipes] Discoplax hirtipes , as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a [Polynesian rat] Polynesian rat ( Rattus exulans Rattus exulans ). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree to disable and consume a [red-footed booby] red-footed booby on the [Chagos Archipelago] Chagos Archipelago . 
The coconut crab can take a coconut from the ground and cut it to a [husk] husk nut, take it with its claw, climb up a tree 10 m (33 ft) high and drop the husk nut, to access the coconut flesh inside. They often descend from the trees by falling, and can survive a fall of at least 4.5 m (15 ft) unhurt. Coconut crabs cut holes into coconuts with their strong claws and eat the contents, although it can take several days before the coconut is opened. 
[Thomas Hale Streets] Thomas Hale Streets discussed the behaviour in 1877, doubting that the animal would climb trees to get at the coconuts. As late as the 1970s there were doubts about the crab's ability to open coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so; if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three [germination] germination pores, the group of three small circles found on the outside of the coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab bangs its pincers on one of them until it breaks. Afterwards, it turns around and uses the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption. 
=== Habitat ===
Coconut crabs are considered one of the most terrestrial-adapted of the decapods, with most aspects of its life oriented to, and centered around such an existence; they will actually drown in sea water in less than a day. Coconut crabs live alone in burrows and rock crevices, depending on the local terrain. They dig their own burrows in sand or loose soil. During the day, the animal stays hidden to reduce water loss from heat. The coconut crabs' burrows contain very fine yet strong fibres of the coconut husk which the animal uses as bedding. While resting in its burrow, the coconut crab closes the entrances with one of its claws to create the moist microclimate within the burrow, which is necessary for the functioning of its breathing organs. In areas with a large coconut crab population, some may come out during the day, perhaps to gain an advantage in the search for food. Other times, they emerge if it is moist or raining, since these conditions allow them to breathe more easily. They live almost exclusively on land, returning to the sea only to release their eggs; on [Christmas Island] Christmas Island , for instance, B. latro B. latro is abundant 6 km ( 3 + + 1 1 ⁄ 2 2 mi) from the sea. 
== Relationship with humans ==
Adult coconut crabs have no known [predators] predators apart from other coconut crabs and humans. Its large size and the quality of its meat means that the coconut crab is extensively hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten as a [delicacy] delicacy – and regarded as an [aphrodisiac] aphrodisiac – on various islands, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. In other regions, there are taboos associated with the crab that prohibit or limit hunting and consumption of Birgus latro Birgus latro . Such taboos have been recorded in the [Nicobar Islands] Nicobar Islands in India, on [Flores Island] Flores Island in Indonesia, and among the [Tao people] Tao people of Taiwan. On the Nicobarian [Kamorta Island] Kamorta Island , it is believed that eating the crab leads to bad luck and can cause severe, sometimes fatal, illnesses. In cases where a local falls ill after consuming the crab, their family creates a wooden replica of the creature. This [effigy] effigy is then taken to the crab's capture site, where specific rituals are performed. 
While the coconut crab itself is not innately [poisonous] poisonous , it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango ( Cerbera manghas [Cerbera manghas] Cerbera manghas ) by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac [cardenolides] cardenolides . 
The pincers of the coconut crab are powerful enough to cause noticeable pain to a human; furthermore, the coconut crab often keeps its hold for extended periods of time. Thomas Hale Streets reports a trick used by [Micronesians] Micronesians of the [Line Islands] Line Islands to get a coconut crab to loosen its grip: ""It may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle titillation of the under soft parts of the body with any light material will cause the crab to loosen its hold."" 
In the [Cook Islands] Cook Islands , the coconut crab is known as unga unga unga or kaveu kaveu kaveu , and in the [Mariana Islands] Mariana Islands it is called ayuyu ayuyu ayuyu , and is sometimes associated with taotaomo'na taotaomo'na [taotaomo'na] taotaomo'na because of the traditional belief that ancestral spirits can return in the form of animals such as the coconut crab. 
A popular [internet meme] internet meme suggests that [Amelia Earhart] Amelia Earhart crash-landed on [Nikumaroro] Nikumaroro and her remains were rapidly consumed by coconut crabs on the island. However, as no evidence of Earhart's plane has been found on or near Nikumaroro, this theory is generally discredited by historians. 
== Conservation ==
Coconut crab populations in several areas have declined or become locally extinct due to both habitat loss and human predation. In 1981, it was listed on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List as a [vulnerable species] vulnerable species , but a lack of biological data caused its assessment to be amended to "" [data deficient] data deficient "" in 1996. In 2018, IUCN updated its assessment to ""vulnerable"". 
Conservation management strategies have been put in place in some regions, such as minimum legal size limit restrictions in [Guam] Guam and [Vanuatu] Vanuatu , and a ban on the capture of egg-bearing females in Guam and the [Federated States of Micronesia] Federated States of Micronesia . In the [Northern Mariana Islands] Northern Mariana Islands , hunting of non-egg-bearing adults above a carapace length of 76 mm (3 in) may take place in September, October, and November, and only under license. The bag limit is five coconut crabs on any given day, and 15 across the whole season. 
In [Tuvalu] Tuvalu , coconut crabs live on the motu motu ( [islets] islets ) in the [Funafuti Conservation Area] Funafuti Conservation Area , a marine conservation area covering 33 km (12.74 mi ) of reef, lagoon and motu motu on the western side of [Funafuti] Funafuti atoll.

Magnificent Frigatebird,Magnificent frigatebird,"
The magnificent frigatebird magnificent frigatebird ( Fregata magnificens Fregata magnificens Fregata magnificens ), frigate petrel frigate petrel or man o' war man o' war is a [seabird] seabird of the frigatebird family [Fregatidae] Fregatidae . With a length of 89–114 centimetres (2 ft 11 in – 3 ft 9 in) and wingspan of 2.17–2.44 m (7 ft 1 in – 8 ft 0 in) it is the largest species of frigatebird. It occurs over tropical and subtropical waters off America, between northern [Mexico] Mexico and [Perú] Perú on the Pacific coast and between [Florida] Florida and southern [Brazil] Brazil along the Atlantic coast. There are also populations on the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands in the Pacific and the [Cape Verde] Cape Verde islands in the Atlantic. It is one of the fastest birds in the world, flying at speeds of up to 95 miles per hour. 
The magnificent frigatebird is a large, lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage, long narrow wings and a deeply forked tail. The male has a striking red [gular sac] gular sac which he inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. Frigatebirds feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (often [flying fish] flying fish ), and sometimes indulge in [kleptoparasitism] kleptoparasitism , harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food.
== Taxonomy ==
The magnificent frigatebird was originally considered to belong to the species Fregata aquila Fregata aquila but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist [Gregory Mathews] Gregory Mathews proposed that the magnificent frigatebird should be considered as a separate species with the [binomial name] binomial name  Fregata magnificens Fregata magnificens . Of the four other species within the genus Fregata Fregata , genetic analysis has shown that the magnificent frigatebird is most closely related to the [Ascension frigatebird] Ascension frigatebird ( Fregata aquila Fregata aquila ). 
There are two [subspecies] subspecies :
Prior to 2022, both these subspecies were considered synonymous with one another and grouped under F. m. magnificens F. m. magnificens . However, they were split by the [International Ornithological Congress] International Ornithological Congress in 2022 based on a 2011 study which examined genetic and morphological variation in magnificent frigatebirds, finding both expected and also highly unexpected results. As predicted by the flight capacity of the species, the authors found signatures of high [gene flow] gene flow across most of the distribution range. This included evidence of recent gene flow among Pacific and Atlantic localities, likely across the [Isthmus of Panama] Isthmus of Panama . This geological formation is a strong barrier to movement in most tropical [seabirds] seabirds . However, the same study also found that the magnificent frigatebird on the Galápagos Islands is genetically and morphologically distinct. Based on this study, the Galápagos population has not been exchanging any genes with their mainland counterparts for several hundred thousand years. 
== History and etymology ==
[Christopher Columbus] Christopher Columbus encountered magnificent frigatebirds when passing the [Cape Verde Islands] Cape Verde Islands on his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492. His journal for the voyage survives in a version made in the 1530s by [Bartolomé de las Casas] Bartolomé de las Casas . The entry for 29 September reads in English:
They saw a bird that is called a frigatebird, which makes the boobies throw up what they eat in order to eat it herself, and she does not sustain herself on anything else. It is a seabird, but does not alight on the sea nor depart from land 20 leagues [97 km; 60 mi]. There are many of these on the islands of Cape Verde.
In the 15th century text the name of the bird is written as rabiforçado rabiforçado . The modern Spanish word for a frigatebird is rabihorcado rabihorcado or ""forked tail"". A population of magnificent frigatebirds once bred on the Cape Verde Islands but is now probably extinct. 
The word frigatebird frigatebird derives from the French mariners' name for the bird La Frégate La Frégate - a [frigate] frigate or fast warship. The etymology of the name was given by French naturalist [Jean-Baptiste du Tertre] Jean-Baptiste du Tertre when describing the magnificent frigatebird in 1667. English mariners referred to frigatebirds as Man-of-War birds. This name was used by the English explorer [William Dampier] William Dampier in his book An Account of a New Voyage Around the World An Account of a New Voyage Around the World published in 1697: 
The Man-of-War (as it is called by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head foremost to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.
The modern name Frigate Bird Frigate Bird was used in 1738 by the English naturalist and illustrator [Eleazar Albin] Eleazar Albin in his A Natural History of the Birds A Natural History of the Birds . The book included an illustration of the male bird showing the red [gular pouch] gular pouch . Like the genus name, the English term is derived from the French mariners' name for the bird la frégate la frégate —a [frigate] frigate or fast warship. 
The genus name, Fregata Fregata has the same source as the English term, and magnificens magnificens is [Latin] Latin for ""splendidly"", from magnificus magnificus , ""grand"". 
== Distribution ==
The magnificent frigatebird is widespread in the tropical [Atlantic] Atlantic , breeding colonially in trees in [Florida] Florida , the [Caribbean] Caribbean and also along the [Pacific] Pacific coast of the [Americas] Americas from Mexico to Ecuador, including the [Galápagos Islands] Galápagos Islands .
It has occurred as a [vagrant] vagrant as far from its normal range as the [Isle of Man] Isle of Man , [Denmark] Denmark , [Spain] Spain , [England] England , [Nova Scotia] Nova Scotia , the [Magdalen Islands] Magdalen Islands , and [British Columbia] British Columbia .
== Description ==
The magnificent frigatebird is the largest species of [frigatebird] frigatebird . It measures 89–114 cm (2 ft 11 in – 3 ft 9 in) in length, has a wingspan of 2.17–2.44 m (7 ft 1 in – 8 ft 0 in) and weighs 1.1–1.59 kilograms (2 lb 7 oz – 3 lb 8 oz). Males are all-black with a scarlet [throat pouch] throat pouch that is inflated like a balloon in the breeding season. Although the feathers are black, the scapular feathers produce a purple iridescence when they reflect sunlight, in contrast to the male [great frigatebird's] great frigatebird's green sheen. Females are black but have a white breast and lower neck sides, a brown band on the wings, and a blue eye-ring that is diagnostic of the female of the species. Immature birds have a white head and underparts.
This species is very similar to the other [frigatebirds] frigatebirds and is similarly sized to all but the [lesser frigatebird] lesser frigatebird . However, it lacks a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a distinctive diamond-shaped belly patch. The magnificent frigatebird is silent in flight, but makes various rattling sounds at its nest.
It spends days and nights on the wing, with an average flapping rate of 2.84 beat per second, ground speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph), covering up to 223 km (139 mi) before landing. They alternately climb in [thermals] thermals , to altitudes occasionally as high as 2,500 m (8,200 ft), and descend to near the sea surface. 
== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===
This bird makes a shallow [platform nest] platform nest on top of both trees and bushes on islands and [cays] cays with [mangroves] mangroves . This nest is constructed out of branches and twigs. 
The magnificent frigatebird lays a [clutch] clutch of one clear white egg that measures .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 68 by 47 millimetres ( 2 + + 3 3 ⁄ 4 4 by 1 + + 3 3 ⁄ 4 4 in) on average. This egg is incubated by both sexes for a period of 50 to 60 days. After the egg hatches, the male parent will abandon it, with the female staying to provision for the young for almost a year. 
=== Feeding ===
This species feeds mainly on [fish] fish , [squid] squid , [jellyfish] jellyfish and [crustaceans] crustaceans . Individual bird diets vary depending on food availability, preferred hunting technique, gender, and age. 
It is a [kleptoparasite] kleptoparasite , pecking at other seabirds to force them to disgorge their meals. After forcing the other seabird to regurgitate its meal, the magnificent frigatebird will dive and catch the prey before it hits the surface of the water. 
== Status ==
The Galápagos population of the magnificent frigatebird may warrant a separate conservation status. This small population of genetically unique magnificent frigatebirds is vulnerable. Any catastrophic event or threats by humans could wipe out the population of approximate two-thousand magnificent frigatebirds that nest on the Galápagos Islands. Magnificent frigatebirds are currently classified as of [Least Concern] Least Concern by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature , but because of the genetic uniqueness of those on the Galápagos Islands this may need to be revisited. 
This population on Cape Verde is thought to be extremely low and on the brink of extinction, despite the original sighting of this species by Columbus likely being that of the Cape Verde population. Protection of the frigatebird's breeding sites is necessary for the species' recovery.

Common Basilisk,Common basilisk,"
The common basilisk common basilisk ( Basiliscus basiliscus Basiliscus basiliscus Basiliscus basiliscus ) is a [species] species of [lizard] lizard in the [family] family  [Corytophanidae] Corytophanidae . The species is [endemic] endemic to [Central America] Central America and [South America] South America , where it is found near rivers and streams in [rainforests] rainforests . It is also known as the Jesus Christ lizard Jesus Christ lizard , Jesus lizard Jesus lizard , South American Jesus lizard South American Jesus lizard , or lagarto de Jesus Cristo lagarto de Jesus Cristo lagarto de Jesus Cristo lagarto de Jesus Cristo for its ability to run on the surface of water.
== Description ==
The common basilisk can be distinguished from similar species within its range by its large size and the high fin-like crest along its back. Most common basilisks are brown and cream in color. Males also have high crests on the head and tail. Both sexes are brown to olive, and have a white, cream, or yellow stripe on the upper lip and a second stripe along either side of the body; these stripes have higher contrast in juveniles and fade as the lizards age.
Hatchlings weigh a mere 2 grams (0.071 oz) and are 38 to 43 mm (1.5 to 1.7 in) long. Adults can grow to a total length (including tail) of 76 cm (2.5 feet). Females are generally 135 to 194 g (4.8 to 6.8 oz), and weigh half as much as males. The tail comprises 70 to 75% of the total length: for example, a 70-cm-long (27.5-inch-long) common basilisk would have a 50-cm-long (19.5-inch-long) tail. The common basilisk has a large mouth with saw-like teeth on the inner sides of the jaw. While the common basilisk is most known for its ability to run on water, it is also an excellent climber and swimmer, and has been known to stay underwater for up to half an hour. The average lifespan is seven years in captivity; in the wild, it tends to be less because of predators.
When startled, the common basilisk escapes by speeding to the nearest edge of water—and continues sprinting. The lizard runs on only its hind legs in an erect position, holding its forelegs to its sides. The common basilisk is adroit on water because its feet are large and equipped with flaps of skin along the toes that allow it to catch on tiny air bubbles. When moving quickly, the lizard can cross a surface of water before sinking. On water, it runs at an average speed of 24.1 km/h (15 mph), which is just a little slower than its speed on land. Younger basilisks can run 10 to 20 m (33 to 66 ft) on water, while adults cross only a few meters before sinking. Adults do not move slowly, but they weigh more and cannot sprint for as long a time. Once a basilisk submerges, it continues swimming until it is sufficiently far from its pursuer — if the predator has followed past the bank. Although the common basilisk stays close to water to escape terrestrial predators, it swims only when necessary because some other aquatic animals would eat it given the chance.
== Geographic range and habitat ==
The common basilisk is found in tropical rainforests throughout Central America and in northwestern South America, usually living in low elevations, from sea level to 600 m (2,000 ft). In [Costa Rica] Costa Rica , this basilisk can be found as high as 1,200 m (3,900 ft) in some places. The species ranges from southwestern [Nicaragua] Nicaragua to northwestern [Colombia] Colombia on the Pacific side, and from central [Panama] Panama to northwestern [Venezuela] Venezuela on the Atlantic side.  In Costa Rica, it is mostly found on the Pacific side of the country. The equivalent species on the Atlantic side is the green basilisk ( Basiliscus plumifrons [Basiliscus plumifrons] Basiliscus plumifrons ), which occupies similar habitats and has similar biology. also recently being found in South Florida.
== Diet ==
B. basiliscus B. basiliscus is an [omnivore] omnivore ; its diet consists of [insects] insects , for example, beetles or dragon flies; flowers, and small vertebrates such as [snakes] snakes , [birds] birds , [eggs] eggs , and [fish] fish . 
== Predators ==
The common basilisk has many natural predators; large reptiles, birds, and some mammals. To avoid predators, it can conceal itself under leaves on the [forest floor] forest floor and can remain motionless for a long time. When the common basilisk must flee, though, its skill of running on water can help it avoid many predators, and when the common basilisk can no longer run on the water, it will use its strong swimming capabilities to continue underwater.
== Reproduction ==
Females of B. basiliscus B. basiliscus lay three to four clutches of 10–20 [eggs] eggs a year. Eggs hatch after about three months and the young weigh about two grams and are up to three inches long. Their outstanding camouflage allows them to remain undetected when they remain still.
== Walking on water ==
The common basilisk, along with the other members of its genus, take the nickname the "" [Jesus Christ] Jesus Christ lizard"" or ""Jesus lizard"" because when fleeing from predators, they gather sufficient momentum to run across the water for a brief distance while holding most of their body out of the water (similar to the [biblical story of Jesus walking on water] biblical story of Jesus walking on water ). Basilisks have large hind feet with scaly fringes on the sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. These are compressed against the toes when this lizard walks on land; but if it senses danger, it can jump into the water, opening up these fringes against the water's surface. This increases the surface area of the foot, thus allowing it to run on the water for short distances. This occurs in three steps. First is the slap, the downward movement of the foot that pushes water out and away from the leg. This also created pockets of air around the foot. Next is the stroke, the backwards movement of the foot, which propels it forward. Next is the recovery, when the foot comes up and out of the water and prepares to do the slap again. Smaller basilisks can run about 10–20 m (33–66 ft) without sinking. Juveniles can usually run farther than older basilisks, while holding more of their body above the water.
== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The common basilisk is named for the creature of [Greek mythology] Greek mythology made up of parts of a [rooster] rooster , [snake] snake , and lion which could turn a man to stone by its gaze: the [basilisk] basilisk . Its [generic] generic , [specific] specific , and common names all derive from the [Greek] Greek  basilískos basilískos (βασιλίσκος), meaning 'little king'. The [specific epithet] specific epithet was given in [Carl Linnæus] Carl Linnæus ' [10th edition] 10th edition of Systema Naturæ [Systema Naturæ] Systema Naturæ .

Gila Monster,Gila monster,"
The Gila monster Gila monster ( Heloderma suspectum Heloderma suspectum Heloderma suspectum , [/ˈhiːlə/] / ˈ ˈ h h iː iː l l ə ə /  [HEE-lə] HEE HEE -lə ) is a species of [venomous] venomous  [lizard] lizard native to the [Southwestern United States] Southwestern United States and the northwestern [Mexican] Mexican state of [Sonora] Sonora . It is a heavy, slow-moving reptile, up to 56 centimetres (22 in) long, and it is the only venomous lizard native to the United States. Its venomous close relatives, the four [beaded lizards] beaded lizards (all former subspecies of Heloderma horridum [Heloderma horridum] Heloderma horridum ) inhabit Mexico and [Guatemala] Guatemala . The Gila monster is sluggish in nature, so it is not generally dangerous and very rarely poses a real threat to humans. However, it has a fearsome reputation and is sometimes killed despite the species being protected by state law in [Arizona] Arizona . 
== History ==
The name ""Gila"" refers to the [Gila River] Gila River Basin in the U.S. states of Arizona and [New Mexico] New Mexico , where the Gila monster was once plentiful.  Heloderma Heloderma means ""studded skin"", from the [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek words helos helos helos ( ἧλος ἧλος ἧλος ), ""the head of a nail or stud"", and derma derma derma ( δέρμα δέρμα δέρμα ), ""skin"". The species epithet suspectum suspectum comes from the describer, paleontologist [Edward Drinker Cope] Edward Drinker Cope . At first, this new specimen of Heloderma Heloderma was misidentified and considered to be a northern variation of the beaded lizard already known to live in Mexico. He suspected that the lizard might be venomous due to the grooves in the teeth. 
The Gila monster is the largest extant lizard species native to North America north of the Mexican border. Its [snout-to-vent length] snout-to-vent length ranges from 26 to 36 cm (10 to 14 in). The tail is about 20% of the body size, and the largest specimens may reach 51 to 56 cm (20 to 22 in) in total length. Body mass is typically in the range of 550 to 800 g (1.21 to 1.76 lb). They appear strong in their body structure with a stout snout, massive head, and ""little""-appearing eyes, which can be protected by a [nictitating membrane] nictitating membrane . 
The Gila monster has four close living relatives, all of which are beaded lizards. There are three species in Mexico: Heloderma exasperatum [Heloderma exasperatum] Heloderma exasperatum , Heloderma horridum [Heloderma horridum] Heloderma horridum and Heloderma alvarezi [Heloderma alvarezi] Heloderma alvarezi , as well as another species in Guatemala: Heloderma charlesbogerti [Heloderma charlesbogerti] Heloderma charlesbogerti . 
The evolutionary history of the Helodermatidae may be traced back to the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous period (145 to 166 million years ago), when Gobiderma pulchrum [Gobiderma pulchrum] Gobiderma pulchrum and Estesia mongolensis [Estesia mongolensis] Estesia mongolensis were present. The genus Heloderma Heloderma has existed since the [Miocene] Miocene , when H. texana H. texana lived. Fragments of [osteoderms] osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in Late [Pleistocene] Pleistocene (10,000 to 8,000 years ago) deposits near [Las Vegas] Las Vegas , [Nevada] Nevada . Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as [living fossils] living fossils . Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the [monitor lizards] monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, their wide geographical separation and distinct features indicate that Heloderma Heloderma is better placed in a separate family. 
== Skin ==
The scales of the head, back, and tail contain little pearl-shaped bones (osteoderms) similar to those found in the beaded lizards from further south. The scales of the belly are free from osteoderms. Female Gila monsters go through a total shed lasting about 2 weeks before depositing their eggs. The dorsal part is often shed in one large piece. Adult males normally shed in smaller segments in August. The young seem to be in constant shed. Adults have more or less yellow to pink colors on a black surface. Hatchlings have a uniform, simple, and less colorful pattern. This drastically changes within the first 6 months of their lives. Hatchlings from the northern area of the species' distribution have a tendency to retain most of their juvenile pattern. It has also been seen that Gila monsters in areas with darker rocks and substrate will have darker colorations. 
The heads of males are very often larger and more triangular-shaped than in females. The length of the tail of the two sexes is statistically very similar, so it does not help in differentiation of the sexes. Individuals with stout tail ends occur in both nature and under human breeding.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The Gila monster is found in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, across a range including Sonora, Arizona, and parts of [California] California , Nevada, [Utah] Utah , and New Mexico. No records have been given from [Baja California] Baja California . They inhabit [scrubland] scrubland , succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with a favorable [microclimate] microclimate and adequate humidity. Gila monsters rely heavily on the use of shelters and spend much of their time dwelling there. Often times these shelters are in rocky areas in Navajo Sandstone and basaltic lava flows. Gila monsters depend on water resources and can be observed in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas, such as flats and open grasslands. 
== Ecology ==
Gila monsters spend 90% of their lifetime underground in burrows or rocky shelters. They are active in the morning during the dry season (spring and early summer). The lizards move to different shelters every 4–5 days up to the beginning of the summer season. By doing so, they optimize for a suitable microhabitat. Later in the summer, they may be active on warm nights or after a [thunderstorm] thunderstorm . They maintain a surface body temperature of about 30 °C (86 °F). Close to 37 °C (99 °F), they are able to decrease their body temperature by up to 2 °C (3.6 °F) by an activated, limited evaporation via the cloaca. One study investigating a population of Gila monsters in southwestern Utah noted that the lizard's activity peaked from late April to mid June. The average distance traveled during their bouts of activity was 210 metres (690 ft), but on occasion some lizards would travel distances greater than 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). During the Gila monster's active season of approximately 90 days, only ten days were spent active. Gila monsters are slow sprinters, but they have relatively high endurance and maximal aerobic capacity ( [VO2max] VO 2 2 max ) compared to other lizards. They are preyed upon by [coyotes] coyotes , [badgers] badgers and [raptors] raptors . Hatchlings are preyed on by snakes, such as [kingsnakes] kingsnakes ( Lampropeltis Lampropeltis sp.).
Among adaptations to a dry environment is a slow metabolism, allowing them to use less than half the amount of energy expected for lizards of their size. Gila monsters, and possibly also the [Mexican beaded lizard] Mexican beaded lizard , store water in their [urinary bladder] urinary bladder and reabsorb it across the bladder epithelium. Their tail is used for energy storage in the form of fat. 
== Diet ==
The Gila monster's diet consists of a variety of food items – small [mammals] mammals (such as young [rabbits] rabbits , [hares] hares , [mice] mice , [ground squirrels] ground squirrels , and other [rodents] rodents ), small [birds] birds , [snakes] snakes , lizards, [frogs] frogs , [insects] insects , other [invertebrates] invertebrates , [carrion] carrion , and the [eggs] eggs of birds, lizards, snakes, and [tortoises] tortoises . Three to four extensive meals in spring are claimed to give them enough energy for a whole season. They can store fat in their tails and therefore do not need to eat often. Nevertheless, they feed whenever they come across suitable prey. Young Gila monsters can swallow up to 50% of their body weight in a single meal. Adults may eat up to one third of their body weight in one meal. 
The Gila monster uses its extremely acute sense of smell to locate prey. The strong, two-ended tipped tongue, which is pigmented in black-blue colors, picks up scent molecules to be transferred to the opening of the [Jacobson organ] Jacobson organ around the middle of the upper mouth cavern.
Prey may be crushed to death if large, or eaten alive, most of the time head first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. After food has been swallowed, the Gila monster may immediately resume tongue flicking and search behavior for identifying more prey such as eggs or young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees, [cacti] cacti , and even fairly straight, rough-surfaced walls. 
== Venom ==
""I have never been called to attend a case of Gila monster bite, and I don't want to be. I think a man who is fool enough to get bitten by a Gila monster ought to die. The creature is so sluggish and slow of movement that the victim of its bite is compelled to help largely in order to get bitten.""
=== Pioneer beliefs ===
In the [Old West] Old West , the pioneers believed a number of myths about the Gila monster, including that the lizard had foul or toxic breath and that its bite was fatal.  The Tombstone Epitaph [The Tombstone Epitaph] The Tombstone Epitaph of [Tombstone, Arizona] Tombstone, Arizona , wrote about a Gila monster that a local person caught on May 14, 1881:
This is a monster, and no baby at that, it being probably the largest specimen ever captured in Arizona. It is 27 inches long and weighs 35 lb. It was caught by H. C. Hiatt on the road between Tombstone and Grand Central Mill, and was purchased by Messrs. Ed Baker and Charles Eastman, who now have it on exhibition at Kelley's Wine House, next door above Grand Hotel, Allen Street. Eastern people who have never seen one of these monsters should not fail to inspect his Aztecship, for they might accidentally stumble upon one some fine day and get badly frightened, except they know what it is.
On May 8, 1890, southeast of [Tucson] Tucson , [Arizona Territory] Arizona Territory , Empire Ranch owner [Walter Vail] Walter Vail captured and thought he had killed a Gila monster. He tied it to his saddle and it bit the middle finger of his right hand and would not let go. A ranch hand pried open the lizard's mouth with a pocket knife, cut open his finger to stimulate bleeding, and then tied saddle strings around his finger and wrist. They summoned Dr. John C. Handy of Tucson, who took Vail back to Tucson for treatment, but Vail experienced swollen and bleeding [glands] glands in his throat for sometime afterward. 
Dr. Handy's friend, Dr. [George Goodfellow] George Goodfellow of Tombstone, was among the first to research the actual effects of Gila monster venom. Scientific American [Scientific American] Scientific American reported in 1890, ""The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed that this is one way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply – the foul gas overcoming them."" Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for Gila monster specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891, he purposely provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When Scientific American Scientific American ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by Gila monsters, but had not died from the bite. 
=== Venom delivery ===
The Gila monster produces venom in modified [salivary glands] salivary glands at the end of its lower jaws, unlike snakes, whose venom is produced in glands behind the eyes. The Gila monster lacks strong musculature in glands above the eyes; instead, in Heloderma Heloderma , the venom is propelled from the gland via a tubing to the base of the lower teeth and then by capillary forces into two grooves of the tooth and then chewed into the victim. The teeth are tightly anchored to the jaw ( [pleurodont] pleurodont ). Broken and regular replacement teeth have to wait every time to go into position in a determinate ""wavelike"" sequence. They change/replace their teeth during their entire life. The Gila monster's bright colors might be suitable to teach predators not to bother this ""painful"" creature. Because the Gila monster's prey consists mainly of eggs, small animals, and otherwise ""helpless"" prey, the Gila monster's venom is thought to have evolved for defensive rather than for hunting use. 
=== Toxicity ===
The venom of a Gila monster is normally not fatal to healthy adult humans. One fatality has been confirmed since 1930, on February 16, 2024, and the rare fatalities recorded before 1930 occurred in adults who were intoxicated by alcohol or had mismanaged the treatment of the bite. The Gila monster can bite quickly and may not release the victim without intervention. If bitten, the victim may attempt to fully submerge the lizard in water, pry the jaws open with a knife or stick, or physically yank the lizard free. While pulling the lizard directly increases risk of severe lacerations from the lizard's sharp teeth, it may also mitigate envenomation. Symptoms of the bite include excruciating pain, edema, and weakness associated with a rapid drop in blood pressure.
YouTuber [Coyote Peterson] Coyote Peterson described the bite as ""like hot lava coursing through your veins"" and claimed it was ""the worst pain [he] had ever experienced"". It is generally regarded as the most painful venom produced by any vertebrate. 
More than a dozen [peptides] peptides and other substances have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including [hyaluronidase] hyaluronidase , [serotonin] serotonin , [phospholipase] phospholipase A 2 2 , and several [kallikrein] kallikrein -like [glycoproteins] glycoproteins responsible for the pain and edema caused by a bite, without producing a [compartment syndrome] compartment syndrome . Four potentially lethal toxins have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, which cause [hemorrhage] hemorrhage in internal organs and exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes), and [helothermine] helothermine , which causes [lethargy] lethargy , partial [paralysis] paralysis of the limbs, and [hypothermia] hypothermia in [rats] rats . Some are similar in action of the [vasoactive intestinal peptide] vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which relaxes [smooth muscle] smooth muscle and regulates water and [electrolyte] electrolyte secretion between the [small] small and [large intestines] large intestines . These bioactive peptides are able to bind to VIP receptors in many different human tissues. One of these, helodermin, has been shown to inhibit the growth of [lung cancer] lung cancer . In February 2024, a Colorado man died after sustaining a 4 minute long bite from a pet Gila Monster. Autopsy reports determined cause of death to come from the animal bite/venom. 
=== Relationship to GLP-1 agonists ===
The constituents of H. suspectum H. suspectum venom that have received the most attention from researchers are the bioactive peptides, including helodermin, helospectin, exendin-3, and exendin-4. Exendin-4, which is specific for H. suspectum H. suspectum , has formed the basis of a class of medications for the treatment of [type 2 diabetes] type 2 diabetes and [obesity] obesity / [metabolic syndrome] metabolic syndrome , known as the [GLP-1 receptor agonists] GLP-1 receptor agonists .
In 2005, the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration] Food and Drug Administration approved the drug [exenatide] exenatide (marketed as Byetta) for the management of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic modification of the protein exendin-4, that was originally isolated from the Gila monster's venom. In a 3-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide showed healthy sustained [glucose] glucose levels. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is 53% identical to [glucagon-like peptide-1] glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate [insulin] insulin and [glucagon] glucagon . Using a sophisticated injection formula with sustained release of the drug, the lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone. This helps diabetics keep their blood glucose levels under control for a week by a single injection. Exenatide also slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss. 
== Life cycle ==
The Gila monster emerges from [brumation] brumation in early March. Gila monsters sexually mature at 4–5 years old. It mates in April and May. The male initiates courtship by flicking his tongue to search for the female's scent. If the female rejects his advances, she will bite him and chase him away. When successful, copulation has been observed in captivity to last from 15 minutes to two and a half hours. There is only a single record of attempted mating outside of a shelter. The female lays eggs at the end of May into June. A clutch may consist of up to eight (rarely more than six) eggs. The incubation in captivity lasts about 5 months, depending on the incubation temperature. The hatchlings are about 16 cm (6.3 in) long and can bite and inject venom as soon as they are hatched.
The egg development and hatching time of young in the wild has been a subject of ongoing speculation. The first model stated that youngsters hatch in fall and stay underground. The second theory postulated a nearly developed embryo remains inside the egg over winter and hatches in spring. Hatchlings (weight about 35 g (1.2 oz)) are observed at the end of April to early June.
Discussions of the exact egg development and hatching cycle of the Gila monster came to an abrupt and unexpected end on October 28, 2016, when a backhoe was digging at the outer walls of a house in a suburb of northern [Tucson] Tucson . The backhoe extracted a nest of a female Gila monster with five eggs in the process of hatching. The Gila monster is now known to hatch near the end of October and immediately proceed into hibernation without surfacing. They then appear on the surface from May through June the following year when prey should be abundant.
In summer, Gila monsters gradually spend less time on the surface to avoid the hottest part of the season; occasionally, they may be active at night. Females that have laid eggs are exhausted and thin, fighting for survival, and have to spend extra effort to ""reconstitute"". The brumation of Gila monsters begins in October. Gila monsters can live up to 40 years in captivity, though rarely.
Little is known about the social behavior of Gila monster, but it has been observed engaging in male to male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. While fighting, both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A ""wrestling match"" ends when the pressure exerts their forces, although bouts may be repeated. These bouts are typically observed in the mating season. Males with greater strength and endurance are thought to enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it has one of the highest aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing it to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time.
== Conservation status ==
Gila monsters are listed as [near threatened] near threatened by the [IUCN] IUCN . They are listed as ""Apparently Secure"" by [NatureServe] NatureServe . 
In 1952, the Gila monster became the first venomous animal to be given legal protection. They are now protected in all states of their distribution. International trade in the species is regulated under Appendix II of [CITES] CITES .
=== Relocation ===
""Possibly the greatest threat to the continued existence of helodermatids is the man-made destruction of their habitat as the land is developed for construction or to create more cultivable land."" Gila monsters found in these situations and relocated – with best intentions – up to 1.2 km (0.75 mi)  away, return to where they were found within 2 months and at great effort. This is up to five times the normal energy use than if they had not been removed, which uses up their energy stores unnecessarily. The same is true for animals relocated to appropriate habitats. Besides this, they also become more exposed to predators. Therefore, the process of simple relocation is ""naïve"" and potentially dangerous for both the relocated animals and existing populations and for the inhabitants of the region where the resettlement is taking place. If relocating the lizards further away, they might be totally disoriented, thus their survival is still very questionable. A more successful strategy would be, for example, if the new ""settlers"" were offered intensive education about this species (e.g., limited toxicity, lifestyle) with the aim of tolerating the reptile or even being proud of having this unique ""roommate"" in one's own neighborhood. 
In 1963, the [San Diego Zoo] San Diego Zoo became the first zoo to successfully breed Gila monsters in captivity. In the last two decades, experienced breeders have shared their knowledge and expertise to give advice to other herpetologists on overcoming the difficulties in Heloderma Heloderma reproduction under human care. 
== Relationship with humans ==
Though the Gila monster is venomous, it poses little threat to humans due to its sluggish nature. Nevertheless, it has a fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans. Myths that have formed about the Gila monster include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom like a [spitting cobra] spitting cobra , that it can leap several feet in the air to attack, and that the Gila monster did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and ""fetid breath"" (perhaps stemming from the fact that its venom in fact has an intense, specific smell). Among Native American tribes, the Gila monster has a varied reputation. The [Apache] Apache believed its breath could kill a man, and the [Tohono O'Odham] Tohono O'Odham and the [Pima] Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the [Seri] Seri and the [Yaqui] Yaqui believed the Gila monster's hide had healing properties. The Navajo/Dine believe the Gila monster was the first medicine man.
=== In popular culture ===
The Gila monster starred as a monster in the film The Giant Gila Monster [The Giant Gila Monster] The Giant Gila Monster (though the titular monster was actually portrayed by a Mexican beaded lizard). It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [The Treasure of the Sierra Madre] The Treasure of the Sierra Madre . In [Brock Brower] Brock Brower 's 1971 novel The Late Great Creature The Late Great Creature , fictional [horror movie] horror movie star Simon Moro is presented as famous for playing the [reptilian] reptilian  [werewolf] werewolf -like Gila Man. The 2011 animated film Rango [Rango] Rango featured a Gila monster as an Old West outlaw named Bad Bill, voiced by [Ray Winstone] Ray Winstone . 
The Gila monster has also seen usage as a [mascot] mascot and [state symbol] state symbol . The official mascot of [Eastern Arizona College] Eastern Arizona College located in [Thatcher, Arizona] Thatcher, Arizona , is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy hat-wearing Gila monster.  In 2017, the [Vegas Golden Knights] Vegas Golden Knights selected a Gila monster named [Chance] Chance as their official mascot. In 2019, the state of Utah made the Gila monster its official [state reptile] state reptile . 
In 2023, Australian band [King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard] King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard released a single titled "" [Gila Monster] Gila Monster "" from their album PetroDragonic Apocalypse [PetroDragonic Apocalypse] PetroDragonic Apocalypse , with the album's artwork featuring a Gila monster on its cover art and heavily within the album's concept narrative.

Saiga Antelope,Saiga antelope,"
The saiga antelope saiga antelope ( [/ˈsaɪɡə/] / ˈ ˈ s s aɪ aɪ ɡ ɡ ə ə / , Saiga tatarica Saiga tatarica Saiga tatarica ), or saiga saiga , is a species of [antelope] antelope which during [antiquity] antiquity inhabited a vast area of the [Eurasian steppe] Eurasian steppe , spanning the foothills of the [Carpathian Mountains] Carpathian Mountains in the northwest and [Caucasus] Caucasus in the southwest into Mongolia in the northeast and [Dzungaria] Dzungaria in the southeast. During the [Pleistocene] Pleistocene , it ranged across the [mammoth steppe] mammoth steppe from the British Isles to [Beringia] Beringia . Today, the dominant subspecies ( S. t. tatarica S. t. tatarica ) only occurs in [Kalmykia] Kalmykia and [Astrakhan Oblast] Astrakhan Oblast of Russia and in the [Ural] Ural , [Ustyurt] Ustyurt and [Betpak-Dala] Betpak-Dala regions of Kazakhstan. A portion of the Ustyurt population migrates south to Uzbekistan and occasionally to Turkmenistan in winter. It is regionally extinct in Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, China and southwestern Mongolia. The Mongolian subspecies ( S. t. mongolica S. t. mongolica ) occurs only in western Mongolia. 
== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
The [scientific name] scientific name  Capra tatarica Capra tatarica was coined by [Carl Linnaeus] Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the [12th edition ofSystema Naturae] 12th edition of Systema Naturae Systema Naturae . It was reclassified as Saiga tatarica Saiga tatarica and is the sole living member of the [genus] genus  Saiga Saiga . Two [subspecies] subspecies are recognised: 
In 1945, American paleontologist [George Gaylord Simpson] George Gaylord Simpson classified both in the [tribe] tribe Saigini under the same subfamily, [Caprinae] Caprinae . Subsequent authors were not certain about the relationship between the two, until [phylogenetic] phylogenetic studies in the 1990s revealed that though morphologically similar, the [Tibetan antelope] Tibetan antelope is closer to the Caprinae while the saiga is closer to the Antilopinae. 
In a revision of the [phylogeny] phylogeny of the [tribe] tribe  [Antilopini] Antilopini on the basis of [nuclear] nuclear and [mitochondrial] mitochondrial data in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the [University of Cambridge] University of Cambridge ) and colleagues showed that the saiga is [sister] sister to the [clade] clade formed by the [springbok] springbok ( Antidorcas marsupialis Antidorcas marsupialis ) and the [gerenuk] gerenuk ( Litocranius walleri Litocranius walleri ). The study noted that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably different from the rest of the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.

Saiga Saiga 
== Evolution ==
Fossils of saiga, concentrated mainly in central and northern Eurasia, date to as early as the late [Pleistocene] Pleistocene (nearly 0.1 [Mya] Mya ). Several species of extinct Saiga Saiga from the Pleistocene of Eurasia and Alaska have been named, including S. borealis S. borealis ,  S. prisca S. prisca , S. binagadensis S. binagadensis and S. ricei S. ricei , although more recent studies suggest that these prehistoric representatives were merely geographical variants of the extant species that was formerly much more widespread. Fossils excavated from the Buran Kaya III site ( [Crimea] Crimea ) date back to the transition from Pleistocene to [Holocene] Holocene . The morphology of saiga does not seem to have changed significantly since prehistoric times. 
Before the Holocene, the saiga ranged across the [mammoth steppe] mammoth steppe from as far west as modern-day England and France to as far east as northern Siberia, Alaska, and probably Canada. The antelope gradually entered the Urals, though it did not colonise southern Europe. A 2010 study revealed that a steep decline has occurred in the genetic variability of the saiga since the late Pleistocene-Holocene, probably due to a [population bottleneck] population bottleneck . 
== Characteristics ==
The saiga stands 61–81 cm (24–32 in) at the shoulder, and weighs 26–69 kg (57–152 lb). The head-and-body length is typically between 100 and 140 cm (39 and 55 in). A prominent feature of the saiga is the pair of closely spaced, bloated nostrils directed downward. Other facial features include the dark markings on the cheeks and the nose, and the 7–12 cm (2.8–4.7 in) long ears. 
The [coat] coat shows seasonal changes. In summer, the coat appears yellow to red, fading toward the flanks. The Mongolian saiga can develop a sandy colour. The coat develops a pale, grayish-brown colour in winter, with a hint of brown on the belly and the neck. The [ventral] ventral parts are generally white. The hairs, that measure 18–30 mm (0.71–1.18 in) long in summer, can grow as long as 40–70 mm (1.6–2.8 in) in winter. This forms a 12 to 15 cm (4.7 to 5.9 in) long mane on the neck. Two distinct [moults] moults can be observed in a year, one in spring from April to May and another in autumn from late September or early October to late November or early December. The tail measures 6–12 cm (2.4–4.7 in). 
Only males possess horns. These horns, thick and slightly translucent, are wax-coloured and show 12 to 20 pronounced rings. With a base diameter of 25–33 mm (0.98–1.30 in), the horns of the Russian saiga measure 28–38 cm (11–15 in) in length; the horns of the Mongolian saiga, however, reach a maximum length of 22 cm (8.7 in). 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
Saigas form very large herds that graze in [semideserts] semideserts , [steppes] steppes , grasslands, and possibly open woodlands, eating several species of plants, including some that are poisonous to other animals. They can cover long distances and swim across rivers, but they avoid steep or rugged areas. The mating season starts in November, when stags fight for the acceptance of females. The winner leads a herd of five to ten females (occasionally up to 50). In springtime, mothers come together in mass to give birth. Two-thirds of births are twins; the remaining third of births are single calves. 
Saigas, like the [Mongolian gazelles] Mongolian gazelles , are known for their extensive migrations across the steppes that allow them to escape natural calamities. Saigas are highly vulnerable to [wolves] wolves . Juveniles are targeted by [foxes] foxes , [steppe eagles] steppe eagles , [golden eagles] golden eagles , and [ravens] ravens .

In the mid-2010s, the populations declined enormously – as much as 95% in 15 years. This led the saiga to be classified as [critically endangered] critically endangered on the [IUCN Red List] IUCN Red List . In more recent years, the saiga has experienced massive regrowth. As of 2022, there is an estimated number of 1.38 million saiga surviving in Kazakhstan, per an April aerial count. As of December 2023, the global saiga antelope population is estimated to number 922,600–988,500 mature individuals. 
In May 2010, an estimated 12,000 of the 26,000 saiga population in the [Ural region] Ural region of Kazakhstan were found dead. Although the deaths are currently being ascribed to [pasteurellosis] pasteurellosis , an infectious disease that strikes the lungs and intestines, the underlying trigger remains to be identified. In May 2015, what may be the same disease broke out in three northern regions of the country. As of 28 May 2015, more than 120,000 saigas have been confirmed dead in the [Betpak-Dala] Betpak-Dala population in central Kazakhstan, representing more than a third of the global population. By April 2016, the saigas appear to be making a comeback, with an increase of population from 31,000 to 36,000 in the Betpak-Dala area. In April 2021 a survey in Kazakhstan found that the saiga population had risen from an estimated 334,000 to 842,000. The population increase was partially attributed to the government crackdown on [poaching] poaching and the establishment of conservation areas. UK charity [RSPB] RSPB reported in 2022 that, partly due to their conservation efforts, as well as the designation of the Bokey Orda-Ashiozek protected area by the Kazakhstan government, the population had now risen to a peak of 1.32 million. 
=== Former range ===
The saiga was not present in Europe during the [Eemian] Eemian . During the [last glacial period] last glacial period , it ranged from the [British Isles] British Isles through [Central Asia] Central Asia and the [Bering Strait] Bering Strait into [Alaska] Alaska and Canada's [Yukon] Yukon and [Northwest Territories] Northwest Territories . By the classical age, they were apparently considered a characteristic animal of [Scythia] Scythia , judging from the historian [Strabo] Strabo 's description of an animal called the kolos kolos that was ""between the deer and ram in size"" and was wrongly believed to drink through its nose. 
Considerable evidence shows the importance of the antelope to [Andronovo culture] Andronovo culture settlements. Illustrations of saiga antelopes can be found among the [cave paintings] cave paintings that were dated back to seventh to fifth century BC. Moreover, saiga bones were found among the remains of other wild animals near the human settlements. 
The fragmented information shows an abundance of saigas on the territory of modern Kazakhstan in the 14th-16th centuries. The migratory routes ranged throughout the country's area, especially the region between the [Volga] Volga and [Ural Rivers] Ural Rivers was heavily populated. The population's size remained high until the second half of the 19th century, when excessive horn export began. The high price and demand for horns drove radical hunting. The number of animals decreased in all regions and the migratory routes shifted southward. Populations in Ukraine were driven to extirpation in the 18th century. 
After a rapid decline, they were nearly completely exterminated in the 1920s, but they were able to recover. By 1950, two million of them were found in the steppes of the USSR. Their population fell drastically following the collapse of the USSR due to uncontrolled hunting and demand for horns in Chinese medicine. At one point, some conservation groups, such as the [World Wildlife Fund] World Wildlife Fund , encouraged the hunting of this species, as its horn was presented as an alternative to that of a [rhinoceros] rhinoceros . 
=== Mongolian saiga ===
The Mongolian saiga ( S. t. mongolica S. t. mongolica ) is found in a small area in western Mongolia around the [Sharga] Sharga and [Mankhan Nature Reserves] Mankhan Nature Reserves . 
== Threats ==
The horn of the saiga antelope is used in [traditional Chinese medicine] traditional Chinese medicine and can sell for as much as US$150.  Demand for the horns drives poaching and smuggling, which has wiped out the population in China, where the saiga antelope is a [class I protected species] class I protected species . 
In June 2014, Chinese customs at the Kazakh border uncovered 66 cases containing 2,351 saiga antelope horns, estimated to be worth over Y70.5 million (US$11 million). In June 2015, E. J. Milner-Gulland (chair of [Saiga Conservation Alliance] Saiga Conservation Alliance ) said: ""Antipoaching needs to be a top priority for the Russian and Kazakh governments."" 
=== Hunting ===
Saigas have been a target of hunting since prehistoric ages, when hunting was an essential means to acquire food. Saigas' horns, meat, and skin have commercial value and are exported from Kazakhstan.
Saiga horn, known as Cornu Antelopis Cornu Antelopis , is one of the main ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine that is used as an extract or powder additive to the elixirs, ointments, and drinks. Saiga horn's value is equal to [rhinoceros horn] rhinoceros horn , whose trade was banned in 1993. Cornu Antelopis is thought to be a cheaper substitute of rare rhino horn in most TCM recipes. 
In the period from 1955 to 1989, over 87 thousand tonnes of meat were collected in Kazakhstan by killing more than five million saiga. In 2011, Kazakhstan reaffirmed a ban on hunting saiga and extended this ban until 2021. 
Saiga meat is compared to [lamb] lamb , considered to be nutritious and delicious. Numerous recipes for cooking the antelope's meat can be found. Both meat and byproducts are sold in the country and outside of it. About 45–80 dm of skin can be harvested from one individual depending on its age and sex. 
=== Physical barriers ===
Agricultural advancement and human settlements have been shrinking habitat areas of the saigas since the 20th century. Occupants limited saiga's passage to water resources and the winter and summer habitats. The ever-changing face of steppe requires saigas to search for new routes to their habitual lands. Currently, saiga populations' migratory routes pass five countries and different human-made constructions, such as railways, trenches, mining sites, and pipelines. These physical barriers limit movement of the antelopes. Cases of saiga herds being trapped within fenced areas and starving to death have been reported. 
=== Climatic variability ===
Saigas are dependent on weather and affected by climate fluctuations to a great extent due to their migratory nature. Harsh winters with strong winds or high snow coverage prevent them from feeding on the underlying grass. Population size usually dramatically decreases after severe cold months. Recent trends in climate change have increased the aridity of the steppe region, leading an estimated 14% or more of available pastureland to be considered degraded and useless. Concurrently, small steppe rivers dry faster, limiting water resources to large lakes and rivers, which are usually populated by human settlements; high temperatures in the steppe region lead to springtime floods, in which saiga calves can drown. 
=== Mass epizootic mortality ===
For [ungulates] ungulates , [mass mortalities] mass mortalities are not uncommon. In the 1980s, several saiga die-offs occurred, and between 2010 and 2014, one occurred every year. The deaths could be linked to calving aggregation, which is when they are most vulnerable. More recent research involving a mass die-off in 2015 indicates warmer weather and attendant humidity led bacteria common in saiga antelopes to move into the bloodstream and cause [hemorrhagic septicemia] hemorrhagic septicemia . 
In May 2015, uncommonly large numbers of saigas began to die from a mysterious [epizootic] epizootic illness suspected to be [pasteurellosis] pasteurellosis . Herd fatality is 100% once infected, with an estimated 40% of the species' total population already dead. More than 120,000 carcasses had been found by late May 2015, while the estimated total population was only 250,000. 
Biologist Murat Nurushev suggested that the cause might be acute [ruminal tympany] ruminal tympany , whose symptoms (bloating, mouth foaming, and diarrhea) had been observed in dead saiga antelopes. According to Nurushev, this disease occurred as a result of foraging on a large amount of easily fermenting plants ( [alfalfa] alfalfa , [clover] clover , [sainfoins] sainfoins , and mixed wet, green grass). In May 2015, the [United Nations] United Nations agency which is involved in saiga conservation efforts issued a statement that the mass die-off had ended. By June 2015, no definitive cause for the epizootic had been found. 
At a scientific meeting in November 2015 in [Tashkent] Tashkent , Uzbekistan, Dr. Richard A. Kock (of the [Royal Veterinary College] Royal Veterinary College in London) reported that his colleagues and he had narrowed down the possible culprits. Climate change and stormy spring weather, they said, may have transformed harmless bacteria, carried by the saigas, into lethal pathogens. 
Pasteurella multocida [Pasteurella multocida] Pasteurella multocida , a [bacterium] bacterium , was determined to be the cause of death. The bacterium occurs in the antelopes and is normally harmless; the reason for the change in behavior of the bacterium is unknown. 
Now, scientists and researchers believe the unusually warm and wet uncontrolled environmental variables caused the bacterium to enter the bloodstream and become septic. [Hemorrhagic septicemia] Hemorrhagic septicemia is the likely cause of the most recent deaths The change of the bacteria may be attributed to ""the response of opportunistic microbes to changing environmental conditions"". 
The Betpak-Dala saiga population in central Kazakhstan, which saw the most deaths, increased from 31,000 after the epidemic to 36,000 by April 2016. 
In late 2016, a large loss of the population happened in Mongolia. The etiology was confirmed to be [goat plague] goat plague in early 2017. 
== Conservation ==
Under the auspices of the [Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals] Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals , the [Saiga Antelope Memorandum of Understanding] Saiga Antelope Memorandum of Understanding was concluded and came into effect on 24 September 2006. 
=== In captivity ===
Currently, only the [Almaty Zoo] Almaty Zoo and [Askania-Nova] Askania-Nova keep saigas.

Velvet Worm,Onychophora,"
Onychophora Onychophora  [/ɒnɪˈkɒfərə/] / ɒ ɒ n n ɪ ɪ ˈ ˈ k k ɒ ɒ f f ə ə r r ə ə / (from [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek : ονυχής ονυχής , onyches onyches onyches , ""claws""; and φέρειν φέρειν φέρειν , pherein pherein pherein , ""to carry""), commonly known as velvet worms velvet worms (for their velvety texture and somewhat wormlike appearance) or more ambiguously as peripatus peripatus  [/pəˈrɪpətəs/] / p p ə ə ˈ ˈ r r ɪ ɪ p p ə ə t t ə ə s s / (after the first described genus, Peripatus [Peripatus] Peripatus ), is a [phylum] phylum of elongate, soft-bodied, many-legged [animals] animals . In appearance they have variously been compared to worms with legs, caterpillars, and slugs. They prey upon other invertebrates, which they catch by ejecting an adhesive slime. Approximately 200 species of velvet worms have been described, although the true number of species is likely to be much greater than that.
The two extant families of velvet worms are [Peripatidae] Peripatidae and [Peripatopsidae] Peripatopsidae . They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found south of the equator. It is the only phylum within [Animalia] Animalia that is wholly endemic to terrestrial environments, at least among extant members. Velvet worms are generally considered close relatives of the [Arthropoda] Arthropoda and [Tardigrada] Tardigrada , with which they form the proposed [taxon] taxon  [Panarthropoda] Panarthropoda . This makes them of palaeontological interest, as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod.  Only two fossil species are confidently assigned as onychophorans: Antennipatus [Antennipatus] Antennipatus from the [Late Carboniferous] Late Carboniferous , and Cretoperipatus [Cretoperipatus] Cretoperipatus from the [Late Cretaceous] Late Cretaceous , the latter belonging to Peripatidae. In modern [zoology] zoology , they are particularly renowned for their curious [mating] mating behaviours and the [bearing of live young] bearing of live young in some species.
== Anatomy and physiology ==
Velvet worms are [segmented] segmented animals with a flattened [cylindrical] cylindrical body cross-section and rows of unstructured body [appendages] appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). They reach lengths between 0.1 and 22 cm (0.04–8.66 in) depending on species, with the smallest known being Ooperipatellus nanus [Ooperipatellus nanus] Ooperipatellus nanus and the largest known is Mongeperipatus solorzanoi [Mongeperipatus solorzanoi] Mongeperipatus solorzanoi . The number of leg pairs ranges from as few as 13 (in Ooperipatellus nanus Ooperipatellus nanus ) to as many as 43 (in Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis [Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis] Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis ). Their [skin] skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin pores, [excretion] excretion organs and concentrations of [nerve cells] nerve cells . The individual body sections are largely [unspecialised] unspecialised ; even the head develops only a little differently from the [abdominal] abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same [gene] gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during [embryonic] embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the [protostome] protostome group, their early development has a [deuterostome] deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development. 
=== Appendages ===
The stub feet that characterise the velvet worms are [conical] conical , baggy appendages of the body, which are internally hollow and have no joints. Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. [Rigidity is provided] Rigidity is provided by the [hydrostatic pressure] hydrostatic pressure of their [fluid] fluid contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal's entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal [muscles] muscles . Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:
On each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) [chitin] chitin claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the [Ancient Greek] Ancient Greek : ονυχής ονυχής , onyches onyches onyches , ""claws""; and φέρειν φέρειν φέρειν , pherein pherein pherein , ""to carry"". At the base of the claws are three to six spiny ""cushions"" on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like [Russian nesting dolls] Russian nesting dolls . The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element, which is fully formed and so does not need time to harden before it is used. This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage. Apart from the pairs of legs, there are three further body appendages, which are at the head and comprise three segments:
The surface of the mandibles is smooth, with no ornamentation. The cuticle in the mandibles (and claws) is distinct from the rest of the body. It has an inner and outer component; the outer component has just two layers (whereas body cuticle has four), and these outer layers (in particular the inner epicuticle) are dehydrated and strongly tanned, affording toughness. 
=== Slime glands ===
On the third head segment, to the left and right of the mouth, are two openings called ""oral papillae"", with each containing a large, heavily branched slime gland. These slime glands lie roughly in the center of a velvet worm's body and secrete a sort of milky-white slime. The slime is used to both ensnare [prey] prey and act as a distraction for defensive purposes. In certain species, an organ connected to the slime gland known as the ""slime conductor"" is broadened into a reservoir, allowing it to hold pre-produced slime. 
Velvet worm slime glands and oral papilla are likely modified and repurposed limbs. The glands themselves are probably modified crural glands. All three structures correspond to an [evolutionary] evolutionary origin in the leg pairs of the other segments. 
=== Skin and muscle ===
Unlike the arthropods, velvet worms do not possess a rigid [exoskeleton] exoskeleton . Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many distantly related soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example [sea anemones] sea anemones and various [worms] worms . Pressure of their [incompressible] incompressible internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the [cuticula] cuticula ; a single layer of [epidermis] epidermis cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a [micrometer] micrometer thick and covered with fine [villi] villi . In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of α-chitin and various [proteins] proteins , although not containing [collagen] collagen . It can be divided into an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly [water-repellent] water-repellent , the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by [respiration] respiration , and, as a result, velvet worms can live only in [microclimates] microclimates with high [humidity] humidity to avoid [desiccation] desiccation . The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny [scales] scales , lending the skin a [velvety] velvety appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin ( [ecdysis] ecdysis ) takes place regularly, around every 14 days, induced by the [hormone] hormone  [ecdysone] ecdysone . The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern. At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either [parallel] parallel or [perpendicular] perpendicular to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments. The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol. 
Within the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised [smooth muscular] smooth muscular tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a [spiral] spiral . Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine [blood vessels] blood vessels , which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings. Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs. 
=== Circulation ===
The body cavity is known as a ""pseudocoel"", or [haemocoel] haemocoel . Unlike a true [coelom] coelom , a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic [mesoderm] mesoderm . A coelom is, however, formed around the [gonads] gonads and the waste-eliminating [nephridia] nephridia . As the name haemocoel haemocoel suggests, the body cavity is filled with a [blood] blood -like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with [nutrients] nutrients circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain [pigments] pigments ; for this reason, it serves only a limited role in [oxygen] oxygen transport.
Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: [Amoebocytes] Amoebocytes and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from [bacteria] bacteria and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in [reproduction] reproduction . Nephrocytes absorb [toxins] toxins or convert them into a form suitable for [elimination] elimination by the nephridia. 
The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm, into two parts: The [pericardial sinus] pericardial sinus along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities. The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of [epithelial] epithelial tissues, with two lateral openings ( [ostia] ostia ) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity.
Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an [open circulation] open circulation . The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: [Diastole] Diastole and [systole] systole . During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also influence circulation. 
=== Respiration ===
Oxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple [diffusion] diffusion through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the [tracheae] tracheae , which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart.
The walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin [membrane] membrane through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the [spiracles] spiracles , which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the [atria] atria . The number of ""tracheae bundles"" thus formed is on average around 75 bundles per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism. 
Unlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in [arid] arid conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars. For this reason, velvet worms are dependent upon [habitats] habitats with high air humidity. 
Oxygen transport is helped by the oxygen carrier [hemocyanin] hemocyanin . 
=== Digestion ===
The digestive tract begins slightly behind the head, the mouth lying on the underside a little way from the frontmost point of the body. Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two [salivary] salivary glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent ""throat"", which makes up the first part of the front [intestine] intestine . The saliva that they produce contains mucus and [hydrolytic] hydrolytic  [enzymes] enzymes , which initiate [digestion] digestion in and outside the mouth.
The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the [oesophagus] oesophagus , which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals.
On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based [peritrophic membrane] peritrophic membrane , which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or [rectum] rectum , which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the [anus] anus , located on the underside near to the rear end. 
In almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a [flagellated] flagellated conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called [podocytes] podocytes , which facilitate [ultrafiltration] ultrafiltration of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium.
The composition of the [urinary] urinary solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble [uric acid] uric acid ; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called [uricotelic] uricotelic excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water. 
A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction. 
=== Sensation ===
The entire body, including the stub feet, is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions responsive to touch that carry a [mechanoreceptive] mechanoreceptive bristle at the tip, each of which is also connected to further [sensory nerve cells] sensory nerve cells lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have some function in [sensory perception] sensory perception . Sensory cells known as ""sensills"" on the ""lips"" or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as [chemoreceptors] chemoreceptors . These are also found on the two antennae, which seem to be the velvet worm's most important sensory organs. 
Except in a few (typically [subterranean] subterranean ) species, one [simply constructed eye] simply constructed eye (ocellus) lies behind each antenna, laterally, just underneath the head. This consists of a chitinous ball [lens] lens , a [cornea] cornea and a [retina] retina and is connected to the centre of the [brain] brain via an [optic nerve] optic nerve . The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose [flagellum] flagellum membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface.
The [rhabdomeric] rhabdomeric eyes of the Onychophora are thought to be homologous with the median ocelli of arthropods; this would suggest that the last common ancestor of arthropods may have only had median ocelli. However, the innervation shows that the homology is limited: The eyes of Onychophora form behind the antenna, whereas the opposite is true in arthropods. 
=== Reproduction ===
Both sexes possess pairs of [gonads] gonads , opening via a channel called a gonoduct into a common genital opening, the [gonopore] gonopore , which is located on the rear ventral side. Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue. 
In females, the two [ovaries] ovaries are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or [egg-laying] egg-laying . In live-bearing species, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy ""womb"", the [uterus] uterus , in which the embryos develop. The single [vagina] vagina , to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the [ovipositor] ovipositor . The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the receptacle seminis receptacle seminis , in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods. 
Males possess two separate [testes] testes , along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the [vesicula seminalis] vesicula seminalis ) and exit channel (the [vasa efferentia] vasa efferentia ). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the [vas deferens] vas deferens , which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve some auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands. A [penis] penis -like structure has so far been found only in males of the genus Paraperipatus Paraperipatus but has not yet been observed in action. 
There are different mating procedures: In some species males deposit their [spermatophore] spermatophore directly into the female's genitals opening, while others deposit it on the female's body, where the cuticle will collapse, allowing the sperm cells to migrate into the female. There are also Australian species where the male place their spermatophore on top of their head, which is then pressed against the female's genitals. In these species the head have elaborate structures like spikes, spines, hollow stylets, pits, and depressions, whose purpose is to either hold the sperm and / or assist in the sperm transfer to the female. The males of most species also secrete a pheromone from glands on the underside of the legs to attract females. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
=== Distribution ===
Velvet worms live in all [tropical] tropical habitats and in the [temperate zone] temperate zone of the [Southern Hemisphere] Southern Hemisphere , showing a [circumtropical] circumtropical and circumaustral distribution. Individual species are found in [Central] Central and [South America] South America ; the [Caribbean] Caribbean islands; [equatorial] equatorial  [West Africa] West Africa and [Southern Africa] Southern Africa ; northeastern [India] India ;  [Thailand] Thailand ;  [Indonesia] Indonesia and parts of [Malaysia] Malaysia ; [New Guinea] New Guinea ; [Australia] Australia ; and [New Zealand] New Zealand . 
Fossils have been found in [Baltic amber] Baltic amber , indicating that they were formerly more widespread in the [Northern Hemisphere] Northern Hemisphere when conditions were more suitable. 
=== Habitat ===
Velvet worms always sparsely occupy the habitats where they are found: They are rare among the fauna which they are a part of. 
All extant velvet worms are terrestrial (land-living) and prefer dark environments with high air humidity. They are found particularly in the [rainforests] rainforests of the tropics and temperate zones, where they live among [moss] moss cushions and [leaf litter] leaf litter , under tree trunks and stones, in rotting wood or in [termite] termite tunnels. They also occur in unforested [grassland] grassland , if there exist sufficient [crevices] crevices in the soil into which they can withdraw during the day, and in caves. Two species live in [caves] caves , a habitat to which their ability to squeeze themselves into the smallest cracks makes them exceptionally well-adapted and in which constant living conditions are guaranteed. Since the essential requirements for cave life were probably already present prior to the settlement of these habitats, this may be described as [exaptation] exaptation . 
Some species of velvet worms are able to occupy human-modified land-uses, such as [cocoa] cocoa and [banana] banana  [plantations] plantations in South America and the Caribbean, but for others, conversion of rainforests is likely one of the most important threats to their survival (see [Conservation] Conservation ). 
Velvet worms are photophobic: They are repelled by bright light sources. Because the danger of [desiccation] desiccation is greatest during the day and in dry weather, it is not surprising that velvet worms are usually most active at night and during rainy weather. Under cold or dry conditions, they actively seek out crevices in which they shift their body into a resting state. 
== Slime ==
The Onychophora forcefully [squirt] squirt glue-like slime from their oral papillae; they do so either in defense against predators or to capture prey. The openings of the glands that produce the slime are in the papillae, a pair of highly modified limbs on the sides of the head below the antennae. Inside, they have a syringe-like system that, by a geometric amplifier, allows for fast squirt using slow muscular contraction. High speed films show the animal expelling two streams of adhesive liquid through a small opening (50–200 [microns] microns ) at a speed of 3 to 5 m/s (10 to 20 ft/s). The interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow produces a passive oscillatory motion (30–60 Hz) of the oral papillae. The oscillation causes the streams to cross in mid air, weaving a disordered net; the velvet worms can control only the general direction where the net is thrown. 
The slime glands themselves are deep inside the body cavity, each at the end of a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which seems provident, since an onychophoran requires about 24 days to replenish an exhausted slime repository. 
The slime can account for up to 11% of the organism's dry weight and is 90% water; its dry residue consists mainly of proteins—primarily a [collagen] collagen -type protein. 1.3% of the slime's dry weight consists of sugars, mainly [galactosamine] galactosamine . The slime also contains lipids and the [surfactant] surfactant  [nonylphenol] nonylphenol . Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes ""slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent"". The proteinaceous composition accounts for the slime's high [tensile strength] tensile strength and stretchiness. The lipid and nonylphenol constituents may serve one of two purposes: They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target. 
== Behaviour ==
=== Locomotion ===
Velvet worms/Onychophora move in a slow and gradual motion that makes them difficult for prey to notice. Their trunk is raised relatively high above the ground, and they walk with non-overlapping steps. To move from place to place, the velvet worm crawls forward using its legs; unlike in arthropods, both legs of a pair are moved simultaneously. The claws of the feet are used only on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws. 
Actual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. Macroperipatus Macroperipatus can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second, although speeds of around 6 body-lengths per minute are more typical. The body gets longer and narrower as the animal picks up speed; the length of each leg also varies during each stride. 
=== Sociality ===
The brains of Onychophora, though small, are very complex; consequently, the organisms are capable of rather sophisticated social interactions. Behaviour may vary from genus to genus, so this article reflects the most-studied genus, Euperipatoides [Euperipatoides] Euperipatoides . 
The Euperipatoides [Euperipatoides] Euperipatoides form social groups of up to fifteen individuals, usually closely related, which will typically live and hunt together. Groups usually live together; in drier regions an example of a shared home would be the moist interior of a rotting log. Group members are extremely aggressive towards individuals from other logs. Dominance is achieved through aggression and maintained through submissive behaviour. After a kill, the dominant female always feeds first, followed in turn by the other females, then males, then the young. 
When assessing other individuals, individuals often measure one another up by running their antennae down the length of the other individual. Once hierarchy has been established, pairs of individuals will often cluster together to form an ""aggregate""; this is fastest in male-female pairings, followed by pairs of females, then pairs of males. 
Social hierarchy is established by a number of interactions: Higher-ranking individuals will chase and bite their subordinates while the latter are trying to crawl on top of them. Juveniles never engage in aggressive behaviour, but climb on top of adults, which tolerate their presence on their backs. Hierarchy is quickly established among individuals from a single group, but not among organisms from different groups; these are substantially more aggressive and very rarely climb one another or form aggregates. Individuals within an individual log are usually closely related; especially so with males. This may be related to the intense aggression between unrelated females. 
=== Feeding ===
Velvet worms are [ambush predators] ambush predators , hunting [only by night] only by night , and are able to capture animals at least their own size, although capturing a large prey item may take almost all of their [mucus] mucus -secreting capacity. They feed on almost any small invertebrates, including woodlice ( [Isopoda] Isopoda ), termites ( [Isoptera] Isoptera ), crickets ( [Gryllidae] Gryllidae ), book/bark lice ( [Psocoptera] Psocoptera ), cockroaches ( [Blattidae] Blattidae ), millipedes and centipedes ( [Myriapoda] Myriapoda ), spiders ( [Araneae] Araneae ), various worms, and even large snails ( [Gastropoda] Gastropoda ). Depending on their size, they eat on average every one to four weeks. They are considered to be [ecologically] ecologically equivalent to centipedes ( [Chilopoda] Chilopoda ).
The most energetically favourable prey are two-fifths the size of the hunting onychophoran. Ninety percent of the time involved in eating prey is spent ingesting it; re-ingestion of the slime used to trap the insect is performed while the onychophoran locates a suitable place to puncture the prey, and this phase accounts for around 8% of the feeding time, with the remaining time evenly split between examining, squirting, and injecting the prey. In some cases, chunks of the prey item are bitten off and swallowed; undigestable components take around 18 hours to pass through the digestive tract. 
Onychophora probably do not primarily use vision to detect their prey; although their tiny eyes do have a good image-forming capacity, their forward vision is obscured by their antennae; their nocturnal habit also limits the utility of eyesight. Air currents, formed by prey motion, are thought to be the primary mode of locating prey; the role of scent, if any, is unclear. Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise. This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm's need to remain moist. Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low cost-benefit ratio, which cannot be achieved with a herbivorous diet. 
Velvet worms literally creep up on their prey, with their smooth, gradual and fluid movement escaping detection. Once they reach their prey, they touch it very softly with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid alerting the prey. This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a decision as to whether to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees. Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime. Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora are determined to pursue and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energy investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it. In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all. Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion. While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey. The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure. The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the liquefied tissue; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction. In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item. After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group. 
=== Reproduction and life-cycle ===
Almost all species of velvet worm reproduce sexually. The sole exception is Epiperipatus imthurni [Epiperipatus imthurni] Epiperipatus imthurni , of which no males have been observed; reproduction instead occurs by [parthenogenesis] parthenogenesis . All species are in principle sexually distinct and bear, in many cases, a marked [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism : the [females] females are usually larger than the [males] males and have, in species where the number of legs is variable, more legs. The females of many species are fertilized only once during their lives, which leads to [copulation] copulation sometimes taking place before the [reproductive organs] reproductive organs of the females are fully developed. In such cases, for example at the age of three months in Macroperipatus torquatus [Macroperipatus torquatus] Macroperipatus torquatus , the transferred sperm cells are kept in a special [reservoir] reservoir , where they can remain [viable] viable for longer periods. Fertilization takes place [internally] internally , although the mode of [sperm] sperm transmission varies widely. In most species, for example in the [genus] genus  Peripatus [Peripatus] Peripatus , a package of sperm cells called the [spermatophore] spermatophore is placed into the genital opening of the female.
The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true [penis] penis having been observed only in species of the genus Paraperipatus Paraperipatus . In many Australian species, there exist [dimples] dimples or special [dagger] dagger - or [axe] axe -shaped structures on the head; the male of Florelliceps stutchburyae [Florelliceps stutchburyae] Florelliceps stutchburyae presses a long [spine] spine against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus Peripatopsis [Peripatopsis] Peripatopsis is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. [Amoebocytes] Amoebocytes from the female's [blood] blood collect on the inside of the [deposition] deposition site, and both the spermatophore's casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the [secretion] secretion of [enzymes] enzymes . This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the [haemocoel] haemocoel , penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the [ova] ova . Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female). Velvet worms are found in egg-laying ( [oviparous] oviparous ), egg-live-bearing ( [ovoviviparous] ovoviviparous ) and live-bearing ( [viviparous] viviparous ) forms.
In a recent peer-reviewed paper published in the ""Journal of Zoology,"" researchers discovered that certain species of Peripatus exhibit a unique form of parental care. Unlike most invertebrates, where parental involvement is minimal, female Peripatus were observed actively guarding their eggs and even providing protection to their offspring after hatching. This finding challenges the conventional understanding of reproductive behavior in invertebrates and highlights the diversity of parenting strategies in the animal kingdom. 
A female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17 months and does not have a [larval] larval stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.
== Ecology ==
The velvet worm's important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with [rodents] rodents and [birds] birds , such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush ( Turdus grayi [Turdus grayi] Turdus grayi ). In South America, Hemprichi's coral snake ( Micrurus hemprichii [Micrurus hemprichii] Micrurus hemprichii ) feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms. For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various [mites] mites ( [Acari] Acari ) are known to be [ectoparasites] ectoparasites infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal. 
The South African species Peripatopsis capensis [Peripatopsis capensis] Peripatopsis capensis has been inadvertently introduced to [Santa Cruz Island] Santa Cruz Island in the [Galapagos Islands] Galapagos Islands , where it co-occurs with native velvet worms. 
== Conservation ==
The global [conservation status] conservation status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically [nocturnal] nocturnal behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the [IUCN] IUCN are:
The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to [industrialisation] industrialisation , draining of [wetlands] wetlands , and [slash-and-burn] slash-and-burn agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important [ecosystems] ecosystems can lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale. There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and [exporting] exporting , while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species. 
== Phylogeny ==
In their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of α-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also a shared feature.
However, the antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae of velvet worms are probably not not homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods; i.e., they probably developed independently.
Another closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears ( [Tardigrada] Tardigrada ); however, due to their very small size, water bears have no need for—and hence lack—blood circulation and separate respiratory structures: shared characteristics that support common ancestry of velvet worms and arthropods.
Together, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a [monophyletic] monophyletic taxon, the [Panarthropoda] Panarthropoda , i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor. Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon Protoarthropoda. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of ""primitive"" and ""highly developed"" organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms' sister groups form a taxon designated [Tactopoda] Tactopoda , thus:
 Velvet worms Velvet worms ( Onychophora Onychophora ) [] 
Water bears ( [Tardigrada] Tardigrada ) [] 
Arthropods ( [Arthropoda] Arthropoda ) [] 
For a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the [annelids] annelids . They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms. Within the [Articulata hypothesis] Articulata hypothesis developed by [Georges Cuvier] Georges Cuvier , the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods' appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered ""living fossils"". This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:
Modern taxonomy does not study criteria such as ""higher"" and ""lower"" states of development or distinctions between ""main"" and ""side"" branches—only family relationships indicated by [cladistic] cladistic methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis — segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called [Ecdysozoa] Ecdysozoa  [hypothesis] hypothesis . This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the [Lophotrochozoa] Lophotrochozoa and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis. Proponents of this hypothesis assume that the aforementioned similarities between annelids and velvet worms either developed convergently or were primitive characteristics passed unchanged from a common ancestor to both the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group [Cycloneuralia] Cycloneuralia , containing the threadworms ( [Nematoda] Nematoda ), horsehair worms ( [Nematomorpha] Nematomorpha ) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons ( [Kinorhyncha] Kinorhyncha ); penis worms ( [Priapulida] Priapulida ); and brush-heads ( [Loricifera] Loricifera ).
 [Panarthropoda] Panarthropoda  (arthropods, velvet worms, water bears) (arthropods, velvet worms, water bears) []  []  [] 
 [Cycloneuralia] Cycloneuralia  (threadworms, horsehair worms, and others) (threadworms, horsehair worms, and others) []  []  [] 
 [Lophotrochozoa] Lophotrochozoa  (annelids, molluscs, and others) (annelids, molluscs, and others)  []  []  [] 
(other Protostomes) (other Protostomes) 
Particularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of ""circumoral"" nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism ( [ecdysis] ecdysis ) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal position of their mouths: Unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back, under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case, and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the [fossil record] fossil record .
The ""stem-group arthropod"" hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the [chelicerates] chelicerates than to any other arthropod. The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor. Important common derivative characteristics ( [synapomorphies] synapomorphies ) include, for example, the mandibles of the second body segment and the oral papillae and associated slime glands of the third; nerve strands extending along the underside with numerous cross-linkages per segment; and the special form of the tracheae. By 2011, some 180 modern species, comprising 49 [genera] genera , had been described; the actual number of species is probably about twice this. According to more recent study, 82 species of Peripatidae and 115 species of Peripatopsidae have been described thus far. However, among the 197 species, 20 are [nomina dubia] nomina dubia nomina dubia , due to major taxonomic inconsistencies. The best-known is the type genus Peripatus [Peripatus] Peripatus , which was described as early as 1825 and which, in English-speaking countries, stands representative for all velvet worms. All genera are assigned to one of two families, the distribution ranges of which do not overlap but are separated by arid areas or oceans:
== Evolution ==
Onychophoran paleontology is plagued by the vagaries of the preservation process that makes fossils difficult to interpret. Experiments on the decay and compaction of onychophora demonstrate difficulties in interpreting fossils; certain parts of living onychophora are visible only in certain conditions:
More significantly, features seen in fossils may be artifacts of the preservation process. For instance, ""shoulder pads"" may simply be the second row of legs coaxially compressed onto the body; branching ""antennae"" may in fact have been created during decay. 
Certain fossils from the early Cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms. These fossils, known collectively as the [lobopodians] lobopodians , were marine and represent a grade from which arthropods, tardigrades, and Onychophora arose. Possible fossils of onychophorans are found in the [Cambrian] Cambrian ,  [Ordovician] Ordovician (possibly),  [Silurian] Silurian and [Pennsylvanian] Pennsylvanian periods.
Historically, all fossil Onychophora and lobopodians were lumped into the taxon [Xenusia] Xenusia , further subdivided by some authors to the Paleozoic Udeonychophora and the Mesozoic/Tertiary Ontonychophora; living Onychophora were termed Euonychophora. Importantly, few of the Cambrian fossils bear features that distinctively unite them with the Onychophora; none can be confidently assigned to the onychophoran crown or even stem group. Possible exceptions are Hallucigenia [Hallucigenia] Hallucigenia and related taxa such as Collinsium ciliosum [Collinsium ciliosum] Collinsium ciliosum , which bear distinctly onychophoran-like claws. It is not clear when the transition to a terrestrial existence was made, but it is considered plausible that it took place between the Ordovician and late Silurian – approximately [490 to 430] 490 to 430 million years ago – via the intertidal zone. 
The low [preservation potential] preservation potential of the non-mineralised onychophorans means that they have a sparse fossil record. The lobopodian Helenodora [Helenodora] Helenodora from the Carboniferous of North America has been suggested to be a member of Onychophora, but other studies recover it as more closely related to other lobopodians. A [Late Carboniferous] Late Carboniferous fossil from [Montceau-les-Mines] Montceau-les-Mines , France, Antennipatus [Antennipatus] Antennipatus has been suggested to have clear onychophoran affinities, likely the first terrestrial onychophoran, but its poor preservation prohibits differentiating between its placement on the stem or crown of the two extant families, or on the onychophoran stem-group. 
In 2018, the identification of Antennipatus Antennipatus as the oldest onychophoran has been argued by Giribet and colleagues, who suggested that the minimum age of Antennipatus Antennipatus would be during the [Gzhelian] Gzhelian age around [298.75] 298.75 million years ago , and incorporated the taxon conservatively for the phylogenetic analysis of oncyhophorans based on the uncertainty of its placement within the order. In 2021, Baker and colleagues conducted divergence analyses using molecular dating and treating Antennipatus Antennipatus conservatively as a stem-group onychophoran with a minimum age of [300] 300 million years ago , resulting in a divergence date of [376] 376 million years ago for the crown group onychophorans. Crown group representatives are known only from amber, the oldest being Cretoperipatus [Cretoperipatus] Cretoperipatus from [Burmese amber] Burmese amber during the [Cenomanian] Cenomanian - [Turonian] Turonian stages of the [Late Cretaceous] Late Cretaceous , around 100-90 million years old, assigned to the family Peripatidae. The affinity of amber records from the Cenozoic, like [Tertiapatus] Tertiapatus , and Succinipatopsis [Succinipatopsis] Succinipatopsis , which form the suggested superfamily termed Tertiapatoidea, has been considered doubtful by other authors.

Lamprey,Lamprey,"
Lampreys Lampreys  [/ˈlæmpreɪz/] / ˈ ˈ l l æ æ m m p p r r eɪ eɪ z z / (sometimes inaccurately called lamprey eels lamprey eels ) are a group of [jawless fish] jawless fish comprising the [order] order  Petromyzontiformes Petromyzontiformes  [/ˌpɛtroʊmɪˈzɒntɪfɔːrmiːz/] / ˌ ˌ p p ɛ ɛ t t r r oʊ oʊ m m ɪ ɪ ˈ ˈ z z ɒ ɒ n n t t ɪ ɪ f f ɔːr ɔːr m m iː iː z z / . The adult lamprey is characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name ""lamprey"" is probably derived from [Latin] Latin  lampetra lampetra lampetra , which may mean ""stone licker"" ( lambere lambere [lambere] lambere ""to lick"" + petra petra [petra] petra ""stone""), though the etymology is uncertain.  Lamprey Lamprey is sometimes seen for the plural form. 
There are about 38 known extant species of lampreys and around seven known extinct species. They are classified in three families: two small families in the [Southern Hemisphere] Southern Hemisphere ( [Geotriidae] Geotriidae , [Mordaciidae] Mordaciidae ) and one large family in the [Northern Hemisphere] Northern Hemisphere ; ( [Petromyzontidae] Petromyzontidae ).
Genetic evidence suggests that lampreys are more closely related to [hagfish] hagfish , the only other living group of jawless fish, than they are to [jawed vertebrates] jawed vertebrates , forming the superclass [Cyclostomi] Cyclostomi . The oldest fossils of [stem-group] stem-group lampreys are from the latest [Devonian Period] Devonian Period , around 360 million years ago, with modern looking forms only appearing during the [Jurassic Period] Jurassic Period , around 163 million years ago, with the modern families likely splitting from each sometime between the [Middle Jurassic] Middle Jurassic and the end of the [Cretaceous] Cretaceous . 
Modern lampreys spend the majority of their life in the juvenile ""ammocoete"" stage, where they burrow into the sediment and [filter feed] filter feed . Adult carnivorous lampreys are the most well-known species, and feed by boring into the flesh of other fish (or in rare cases marine mammals) to consume flesh and/or [blood] blood ; but only 18 species of lampreys engage in this predatory lifestyle (with Caspiomyzon [Caspiomyzon] Caspiomyzon suggested to feed on [carrion] carrion rather than live prey ). Of the 18 carnivorous species, nine [migrate from saltwater to freshwater to breed] migrate from saltwater to freshwater to breed (some of them also have freshwater populations), and nine live exclusively in freshwater. All non-carnivorous forms are freshwater species. Adults of the non-carnivorous species do not feed; they live on reserves acquired as ammocoetes.
== Distribution ==
Lampreys live mostly in coastal and fresh waters and are found in most temperate regions. Some [species] species (e.g. Geotria australis [Geotria australis] Geotria australis , Petromyzon marinus [Petromyzon marinus] Petromyzon marinus , and Entosphenus tridentatus [Entosphenus tridentatus] Entosphenus tridentatus ) travel significant distances in the open ocean, as evidenced by their lack of [reproductive isolation] reproductive isolation between populations. Other species are found in land-locked lakes. Their [larvae] larvae ( ammocoetes ammocoetes ) have a low tolerance for high water temperatures, which may explain why they are not distributed in the tropics.
Lamprey distribution may be adversely affected by river habitat loss, overfishing and pollution. In Britain, at the time of the 11th-century [Norman Conquest] Norman Conquest of England, lampreys were found as far upstream in the [River Thames] River Thames as [Petersham] Petersham . The reduction of pollution in the Thames and [River Wear] River Wear has led to recent sightings in London and [Chester-le-Street] Chester-le-Street . 
Distribution of lampreys may also be adversely affected by dams and other construction projects due to disruption of migration routes and obstruction of access to spawning grounds. Conversely, the construction of artificial channels has exposed new habitats for colonisation, notably in North America where sea lampreys have become a significant introduced pest in the [Great Lakes] Great Lakes . Active control programs to control lampreys are undergoing modifications due to concerns of drinking water quality in some areas. 
== Biology ==
=== Anatomy ===
Adults superficially resemble [eels] eels in that they have [scaleless] scaleless , elongated bodies, with the largest species, the [sea lamprey] sea lamprey having a maximum body length of around 1.2 metres (3.9 ft). Lacking [paired fins] paired fins , adult lampreys have one nostril atop the head and seven [gill] gill pores on each side of the head. 
The brain of the lamprey is divided into the [telencephalon] telencephalon , [diencephalon] diencephalon , [midbrain] midbrain , [cerebellum] cerebellum , and [medulla] medulla . 
Lampreys have been described as the only living vertebrates to have four eyes, having a single pair of regular eyes as well as two [parietal eyes] parietal eyes : a pineal and parapineal one (the exception is members of Mordacia [Mordacia] Mordacia ). The eyes of juvenile lampreys are poorly developed eyespot-like structures that are covered in non-transparent skin, while the eyes of adult lampreys are well developed.  [Accommodation] Accommodation is done by flattening the cornea, which pushes the lens towards the retina. The eye of family Mordaciidae possess just a single type of photoreceptor (rod-like), the family Petromyzontidae possess two photoreceptor types (a cone-like and a rod-like), and the family Geotriidae possesses five types of photoreceptors. 
The [buccal cavity] buccal cavity , anterior to the [gonads] gonads , is responsible for attaching the animal, through suction, to either a stone or its prey. This then allows the tongue to make contact with the stone to rasp [algae] algae , or tear at the flesh of their prey to yield blood. 
The [last common ancestor] last common ancestor of lampreys appears to have been specialized to feed on the blood and body fluids of other fish after metamorphosis. They attach their mouthparts to the target animal's body, then use three horny plates (laminae) on the tip of their piston-like tongue, one transversely and two longitudinally placed, to scrape through surface tissues until they reach body fluids. The teeth on their oral disc are primarily used to help the animal attach itself to its prey. Made of keratin and other proteins, lamprey teeth have a hollow core to give room for replacement teeth growing under the old ones. Some of the original blood-feeding forms have evolved into species that feed on both blood and flesh, and some who have become specialized to eat flesh and may even invade the internal organs of the host. Tissue feeders can also involve the teeth on the oral disc in the excision of tissue. As a result, the flesh-feeders have smaller buccal glands as they do not require the production of anticoagulant continuously and mechanisms for preventing solid material entering the branchial pouches, which could otherwise potentially clog the gills. A study of the stomach content of some lampreys has shown the remains of intestines, fins and vertebrae from their prey. 
Close to the jaws of juvenile lampreys, a muscular flap-like structure called the velum is present, which serves to generate a water current towards the mouth opening, which enables feeding and respiration. 
The unique morphological characteristics of lampreys, such as their [cartilaginous] cartilaginous  [skeleton] skeleton , suggest they are the sister taxon (see [cladistics] cladistics ) of all living jawed vertebrates ( [gnathostomes] gnathostomes ). They are usually considered the most basal group of the [Vertebrata] Vertebrata . Instead of true vertebrae, they have a series of cartilaginous structures called arcualia arranged above the notochord. [Hagfish] Hagfish , which resemble lampreys, have traditionally been considered the sister taxon of the true vertebrates (lampreys and gnathostomes) but DNA evidence suggests that they are in fact the sister taxon of lampreys. 
The [heart] heart of the lamprey is anterior to the intestines. It contains the [sinus] sinus , one [atrium] atrium , and one [ventricle] ventricle protected by the pericardial cartilages. 
The [pineal gland] pineal gland , a photosensitive organ regulating [melatonin] melatonin production by capturing light signals through the [photoreceptor cell] photoreceptor cell converting them into intercellular signals of the lamprey is located in the midline of its body, for lamprey, the [pineal eye] pineal eye is accompanied by the parapineal organ. 
One of the key physical components to the lamprey are the [intestines] intestines , which are located ventral to the [notochord] notochord . Intestines aid in [osmoregulation] osmoregulation by intaking water from its environment and desalinating the water they intake to an [iso-osmotic] iso-osmotic state with respect to blood, and are also responsible for [digestion] digestion .
Studies have shown that lampreys are among the most energy-efficient swimmers. Their swimming movements generate low-pressure zones around the body, which pull rather than push their bodies through the water. 
Different species of lamprey have many shared physical characteristics. The same anatomical structure can serve different functions in the lamprey depending on whether or not it is [carnivorous] carnivorous . The mouth and suction capabilities of the lamprey not only allow it to cling to a fish as a [parasite] parasite , but provide it with limited climbing ability so that it can travel upstream and up ramps or rocks to breed. This ability has been studied in an attempt to better understand how lampreys battle the current and move forward despite only being able to hold onto the rock at a single point. Some scientists are also hoping to design ramps that will optimize the lamprey's climbing ability, as lampreys are valued as food in the Northwest United States and need to travel upstream to reproduce. 
Many lampreys exhibit [countershading] countershading , a form of [camouflage] camouflage . Similarly to many other aquatic species, most lampreys have a dark-colored back, which enables them to blend in with the ground below when seen from above by a predator. Their light-colored undersides allow them to blend in with the bright air and water above them if a predator sees them from below.
Lamprey coloration can also vary according to the region and specific environment in which the species is found. Some species can be distinguished by their unique markings – for example, [Geotria australis] Geotria australis Geotria australis individuals display two bluish stripes running the length of its body as an adult. These markings can also sometimes be used to determine what stage of the life cycle the lamprey is in; [G. australis] G. australis G. australis individuals lose these stripes when they approach the reproductive phase and begin to travel upstream. Another example is Petromyzon marinus [Petromyzon marinus] Petromyzon marinus , which shifts to more of an orange color as it reaches the reproductive stage in its life cycle.
=== Genetics and immunology ===
Northern lampreys ( [Petromyzontidae] Petromyzontidae ) have the highest number of [chromosomes] chromosomes (164–174) among vertebrates. Due to certain peculiarities in their [adaptive immune system] adaptive immune system , the study of lampreys provides valuable insight into the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity. Generated from a somatic recombination of [leucine-rich repeat] leucine-rich repeat gene segments, lamprey leukocytes express surface [variable lymphocyte receptors] variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). This convergently evolved characteristic allows them to have lymphocytes that work as the [T cells] T cells and [B cells] B cells present in higher vertebrates immune system.  [Pouched lamprey] Pouched lamprey ( Geotria australis Geotria australis ) larvae also have a very high tolerance for free iron in their bodies, and have well-developed biochemical systems for detoxification of the large quantities of these metal ions. 
=== Lifecycle ===
The adults spawn in nests of sand, gravel and pebbles in clear streams. After hatching from the eggs, young larvae—called ammocoetes —will drift downstream with the current till they reach soft and fine sediment in silt beds, where they will burrow in silt, mud and detritus, taking up an existence as filter feeders, collecting detritus, algae, and microorganisms. The eyes of the larvae are underdeveloped, but are capable of discriminating changes in illuminance. Ammocoetes can grow from 3–4 inches (8–10 centimetres) to about 8 inches (20 cm). Many species change color during a [diurnal cycle] diurnal cycle , becoming dark at day and pale at night. The skin also has [photoreceptors] photoreceptors , light sensitive cells, most of them concentrated in the tail, which helps them to stay buried. Lampreys may spend up to eight years as ammocoetes, while species such as the [Arctic lamprey] Arctic lamprey may only spend one to two years as larvae, prior to undergoing a metamorphosis which generally lasts 3–4 months, but can vary between species. While metamorphosing, they do not eat. 
The rate of water moving across the ammocoetes' feeding apparatus is the lowest recorded in any suspension feeding animal, and they therefore require water rich in nutrients to fulfill their nutritional needs. While the majority of (invertebrate) suspension feeders thrive in waters containing under 1 mg suspended organic solids per litre (<1 mg/L), ammocoetes demand minimum 4 mg/L, with concentrations in their habitats having been measured up to 40 mg/L. 
During metamorphosis the lamprey loses both the [gallbladder] gallbladder and the [biliary tract] biliary tract , and the [endostyle] endostyle turns into a [thyroid] thyroid gland. 
Some species, including those that are not carnivorous and do not feed even following metamorphosis, live in freshwater for their entire lifecycle, spawning and dying shortly after metamorphosing. In contrast, many species are [anadromous] anadromous and migrate to the sea, beginning to prey on other animals while still swimming downstream after their metamorphosis provides them with eyes, teeth, and a sucking mouth. Those that are anadromous are carnivorous, feeding on fishes or marine mammals. 
Anadromous lampreys spend up to four years in the sea before migrating back to freshwater, where they spawn. Adults create nests (called [redds] redds ) by moving rocks, and females release thousands of eggs, sometimes up to 100,000. The male, intertwined with the female, fertilizes the eggs simultaneously. Being [semelparous] semelparous , both adults die after the eggs are fertilized. 
Research on sea lampreys has revealed that sexually mature males use a specialized heat-producing tissue in the form of a ridge of fat cells near the anterior dorsal fin to stimulate females. After having attracted a female with pheromones, the heat detected by the female through body contact will encourage spawning. 
== Classification ==
Taxonomists place lampreys and hagfish in the subphylum [Vertebrata] Vertebrata of the [phylum] phylum  [Chordata] Chordata , which also includes the invertebrate subphyla [Tunicata] Tunicata (sea-squirts) and the fish-like [Cephalochordata] Cephalochordata ( [lancelets] lancelets or Amphioxus). Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and hagfish in the infraphylum [Agnatha] Agnatha or [Agnathostomata] Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate infraphylum is [Gnathostomata] Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes [Chondrichthyes] Chondrichthyes (sharks), [Osteichthyes] Osteichthyes (bony fishes), [Amphibia] Amphibia , [Reptilia] Reptilia , [Aves] Aves , and [Mammalia] Mammalia .
Some researchers have classified lampreys as the sole surviving representatives of the [Linnean] Linnean  [class] class  [Cephalaspidomorphi] Cephalaspidomorphi . Cephalaspidomorpha is sometimes given as a subclass of the Cephalaspidomorphi.
Fossil evidence now suggests lampreys and cephalaspids acquired their shared characters by [convergent evolution] convergent evolution . The 5th edition of Fishes of the World [Fishes of the World] Fishes of the World classifies lampreys within the Class Petromyzontida, a taxon called Petromyzonti in Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes [Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes] Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes . 
The debate about their systematics notwithstanding, lampreys constitute a single [order] order  Petromyzontiformes Petromyzontiformes . Sometimes still seen is the alternative spelling ""Petromyzoniformes"" ""Petromyzoniformes"" , based on the argument that the [type genus] type genus is Petromyzon [Petromyzon] Petromyzon and not ""Petromyzonta"" or similar. Throughout most of the 20th century, both names were used indiscriminately, even by the same author in subsequent publications. In the mid-1970s, the [ICZN] ICZN was called upon to fix one name or the other, and after much debate had to resolve the issue by voting. Thus, in 1980, the spelling with a ""t"" won out, and in 1981, it became official that all higher-level taxa based on Petromyzon Petromyzon have to start with ""Petromyzont-"".

Recent studies differ regarding the timing of the last common ancestor of all living lampreys, with some suggesting a Middle Jurassic date, around 175 million years ago, while other studies have suggested a younger split, dating to the Late Cretaceous. The older date study posited that the Northern and Southern Hemisphere lampreys diverged as part of the breakup of [Pangea] Pangea , while the Late Cretaceous study suggested that modern lampreys emerged in the Southern Hemisphere. It is thought that most modern lamprey diversity emerged during the Cenozoic, particularly within the last 10–20 million years. 
== Fossil record ==
The oldest fossil lamprey, Priscomyzon [Priscomyzon] Priscomyzon , is known from the latest [Devonian] Devonian of South Africa around 360 million years ago, with other [stem-group] stem-group lampreys, like Pipiscius [Pipiscius] Pipiscius , Mayomyzon [Mayomyzon] Mayomyzon and Hardistiella [Hardistiella] Hardistiella known from the [Carboniferous] Carboniferous of North America. These [Paleozoic] Paleozoic stem-lampreys are small relative to modern lampreys, and while they had well developed oral discs with a small number of radially arranged teeth, they lacked the specialised, heavily toothed discs with plate-like laminae present in modern lampreys, and it is possible that they fed by scraping algae off of animals, rather than feeding by predation/parasitism. They also lacked the modern three stage life cycle including ammocoetes found in modern lampreys, with the juvenile stages of these species closely resembling adults.  Myxineidus [Myxineidus] Myxineidus from the Carboniferous of France, often considered to be a [hagfish] hagfish , has been found to be a lamprey in some studies. The earliest lamprey with the specialised toothed oral disc typical of modern lampreys is Yanliaomyzon [Yanliaomyzon] Yanliaomyzon from the Middle [Jurassic] Jurassic of China around 163 million years old, which is thought to have had a predatory lifestyle like modern lampreys, and probably had a three stage life cycle including ammocoetes.  Mesomyzon [Mesomyzon] Mesomyzon from the Early [Cretaceous] Cretaceous of China, which displays the three stage life cycle with ammocoetes, was found in one study to be more closely related to the family Petromyzonidae than to other living lampreys, though other studies have found it to be outside the group containing all living lampreys. 
== Lamprey and chordate synapomorphies ==
[Synapomorphies] Synapomorphies are certain characteristics that are shared over evolutionary history. Organisms possessing a [notochord] notochord , [dorsal hollow nerve cord] dorsal hollow nerve cord , [pharyngeal slits] pharyngeal slits , [pituitary gland] pituitary gland / [endostyle] endostyle , and a post anal tail during the process of their development are considered to be [chordates] chordates . Lampreys contain these characteristics that define them as chordates. Lamprey anatomy is very different based on what stage of development they are in. The [notochord] notochord is derived from the [mesoderm] mesoderm and is one of the defining characteristics of a chordate. The notochord provides signaling and mechanical cues to help the organism when swimming. The [dorsal nerve cord] dorsal nerve cord is another characteristic of lampreys that defines them as chordates. During development this part of the ectoderm rolls creating a hollow tube. This is often why it is referred to as the dorsal ""hollow"" nerve cord. The third chordate feature, which are the [pharyngeal slits] pharyngeal slits , are openings found between the pharynx or throat. Pharyngeal slits are filter feeding organs that help the movement of water through the mouth and out of these slits when feeding. During the lamprey's larval stage they feed by filter feeding. Once lampreys reach their adult phase they become [parasitic] parasitic on other fish, and these [gill slits] gill slits become very important in aiding in the respiration of the organism. The final chordate synapomorphy is the post anal tail, which is muscular and extends behind the anus.
Oftentimes adult [amphioxus] amphioxus and lamprey larvae are compared by anatomists due to their similarities. Similarities between adult amphioxus and lamprey larvae include a pharynx with pharyngeal slits, a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord and a series of [somites] somites that extend anterior to the [otic vesicle] otic vesicle . 
== Use in research ==
The lamprey has been extensively studied because its relatively simple brain is thought in many respects to reflect the brain structure of early vertebrate ancestors. Beginning in the 1970s, [Sten Grillner] Sten Grillner and his colleagues at the [Karolinska Institute] Karolinska Institute in Stockholm followed on from extensive work on the lamprey started by Carl Rovainen in the 1960s that used the lamprey as a model system to work out the fundamental principles of motor control in vertebrates starting in the spinal cord and working toward the brain. 
In a series of studies by Rovainen and his student James Buchanan, the cells that formed the neural circuits within the spinal cord capable of generating the rhythmic motor patterns that underlie swimming were examined. Note that there are still missing details in the network scheme despite claims by Grillner that the network is characterised (Parker 2006, 2010 ). Spinal cord circuits are controlled by specific locomotor areas in the brainstem and midbrain, and these areas are in turn controlled by higher brain structures, including the basal ganglia and [tectum] tectum .
In a study of the lamprey tectum published in 2007, they found electrical stimulation could elicit eye movements, lateral bending movements, or swimming activity, and the type, amplitude, and direction of movement varied as a function of the location within the tectum that was stimulated. These findings were interpreted as consistent with the idea that the tectum generates goal-directed locomotion in the lamprey.
Lampreys are used as a [model organism] model organism in biomedical research, where their large reticulospinal [axons] axons are used to investigate [synaptic transmission] synaptic transmission . The axons of lamprey are particularly large and allow for [microinjection] microinjection of substances for experimental manipulation.
They are also capable of full functional recovery after complete spinal cord transection. Another trait is the ability to delete several genes from their [somatic cell] somatic cell lineages, about 20% of their DNA, which are vital during development of the embryo, but which in humans can cause problems such as cancer later in life, after they have served their purpose. How the genes destined for deletion are targeted is not yet known. 
== Relationship with humans ==
=== Attacks on humans ===
Although attacks on humans have been documented, they will generally not attack humans unless starved. 
=== As food ===
People have long eaten lampreys. They were highly appreciated by the [ancient Romans] ancient Romans . During the [Middle Ages] Middle Ages they were [widely eaten] widely eaten by the upper classes throughout Europe, especially during [Lent] Lent , [when eating meat was prohibited] when eating meat was prohibited , due to their meaty taste and texture. King [Henry I of England] Henry I of England is claimed to have been so fond of lampreys that he often ate them, late into life and poor health, against the advice of his physician concerning their richness, and is said to have died from eating ""a [surfeit] surfeit of lampreys"". Whether or not his lamprey indulgence actually caused his death is unclear, but [the phrase persists] the phrase persists in British culture.
A [lamprey pie] lamprey pie was made for the [coronation of Elizabeth II] coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. Sixty years later, the city of Gloucester had to use fish from North America for [her Diamond Jubilee] her Diamond Jubilee , because few lampreys could be found in the [River Severn] River Severn . 
In southwestern Europe (Portugal, Spain, and France), Finland and in Latvia (where lamprey is routinely sold in supermarkets), lampreys are a highly prized [delicacy] delicacy . In Finland (county of [Nakkila] Nakkila ), and Latvia ( [Carnikava Municipality] Carnikava Municipality ), the river lamprey is the local symbol, found on their coats of arms. In 2015 the lamprey from Carnikava was included in the [Protected designation of origin] Protected designation of origin list by the [European Commission] European Commission . 
[Sea lamprey] Sea lamprey is the most sought-after species in [Portugal] Portugal and one of only two that can legally bear the commercial name ""lamprey"" ( lampreia lampreia ): the other one being Lampetra fluviatilis Lampetra fluviatilis , the [European river lamprey] European river lamprey , both according to Portaria (Government regulation no. 587/2006, from 22 June). ""Arroz de lampreia"" (lamprey rice) and ""Lampreia à Bordalesa"" (Bordeaux style lamprey) are some of the most important dishes in [Portuguese cuisine] Portuguese cuisine .
Lampreys are also consumed in Sweden, Russia, Lithuania, Estonia, Japan, and South Korea. In Finland, they are commonly eaten grilled or smoked, but also [pickled] pickled , or in vinegar. 
The [mucus] mucus and [serum] serum of several lamprey species, including the [Caspian lamprey] Caspian lamprey ( Caspiomyzon wagneri Caspiomyzon wagneri ), river lampreys ( Lampetra fluviatilis Lampetra fluviatilis and L. planeri L. planeri ), and sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus Petromyzon marinus ), are known to be toxic, and require thorough cleaning before cooking and consumption. 
In Britain, lampreys are commonly used as [bait] bait , normally as dead bait. [Northern pike] Northern pike , [perch] perch , and [chub] chub all can be caught on lampreys. Frozen lampreys can be bought from most bait and [tackle] tackle shops.
=== As pests ===
Sea lampreys have become a major [pest] pest in the North American [Great Lakes] Great Lakes . It is generally believed that they gained access to the lakes via [canals] canals during the early 20th century, but this theory is controversial. They are considered an [invasive species] invasive species , have no natural predators in the lakes, and prey on many species of commercial value, such as [lake trout] lake trout . 
Lampreys are now found mostly in the streams that feed the lakes, and controlled with special barriers to prevent the upstream movement of adults, or by the application of toxicants called [lampricides] lampricides , which are harmless to most other aquatic species; however, these programs are complicated and expensive, and do not eradicate the lampreys from the lakes, but merely keep them in check. 
New programs are being developed, including the use of chemically [sterilized] sterilized male lampreys in a method akin to the [sterile insect technique] sterile insect technique . Finally, [pheromones] pheromones critical to lamprey migratory behaviour have been isolated, their [chemical structures] chemical structures determined, and their impact on lamprey behaviour studied, in the laboratory and in the wild, and active efforts are underway to chemically source and to address regulatory considerations that might allow this strategy to proceed. 
Control of sea lampreys in the Great Lakes is conducted by the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the [Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans] Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans , and is coordinated by the [Great Lakes Fishery Commission] Great Lakes Fishery Commission .  [Lake Champlain] Lake Champlain , bordered by [New York] New York , [Vermont] Vermont , and [Quebec] Quebec , and New York's [Finger Lakes] Finger Lakes are also home to high populations of sea lampreys that warrant control. Lake Champlain's lamprey control program is managed by the [New York State Department of Environmental Conservation] New York State Department of Environmental Conservation , the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. New York's Finger Lakes sea lamprey control program is managed solely by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. 
=== In folklore ===
In folklore, lampreys are called ""nine-eyed eels"". The name derives from misconstruing the seven gill pores behind each eye as additional eyes, and doing the same with the nostril on the top of the head (even though there is only one of those, not one per side). Likewise, in the German language, the word for lamprey is Neunauge Neunauge , which means ""nine-eye"". In British folklore, the monster known as the [Lambton Worm] Lambton Worm may have been based on a lamprey, since it is described as an eel-like creature with nine eyes. 
In Japanese, lamprey are called yatsume-unagi yatsume-unagi (八つ目鰻, ""eight-eyed eels""), thus excluding the nostril from the count. 
=== In literature ===
[Vedius Pollio] Vedius Pollio kept a pool of lampreys into which [slaves] slaves who incurred his displeasure would be thrown as food. On one occasion, Vedius was punished by [Augustus] Augustus for attempting to do so in his presence:
... one of his slaves had broken a crystal cup. Vedius ordered him to be seized and then put to death, but in an unusual way. He ordered him to be thrown to the huge lampreys which he had in his fish pond. Who would not think he did this for display? Yet it was out of cruelty. The boy slipped from the captor's hands and fled to Augustus's feet asking nothing else other than a different way to die – he did not want to be eaten. Augustus was moved by the novelty of the cruelty and ordered him to be released, all the crystal cups to be broken before his eyes, and the fish pond to be filled in ...
This incident was incorporated into the plot of the 2003 novel Pompeii [Pompeii] Pompeii by [Robert Harris] Robert Harris in the incident of Ampliatus feeding a slave to his lampreys.
[Lucius Licinius Crassus] Lucius Licinius Crassus was mocked by [Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus] Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (cos. 54 BC) for weeping over the death of his pet lamprey:
So, when Domitius said to Crassus the orator, Did not you weep for the death of the lamprey you kept in your fish pond? – Did not you, said Crassus to him again, bury three wives without ever shedding a tear? – [Plutarch] Plutarch , On the Intelligence of Animals On the Intelligence of Animals , 976a
This story is also found in Aelian (Various Histories VII, 4) and [Macrobius] Macrobius ( [Saturnalia] Saturnalia III.15.3). It is included by [Hugo von Hofmannsthal] Hugo von Hofmannsthal in the [Chandos Letter] Chandos Letter :
And in my mind I compare myself from time to time with the orator Crassus, of whom it is reported that he grew so excessively enamoured of a tame lamprey – a dumb, apathetic, red-eyed fish in his ornamental pond – that it became the talk of the town; and when one day in the Senate Domitius reproached him for having shed tears over the death of this fish, attempting thereby to make him appear a fool, Crassus answered, ""Thus have I done over the death of my fish as you have over the death of neither your first nor your second wife.""
I know not how oft this Crassus with his lamprey enters my mind as a mirrored image of my Self, reflected across the abyss of centuries.
In [George R. R. Martin] George R. R. Martin 's novel series, A Song of Ice and Fire [A Song of Ice and Fire] A Song of Ice and Fire , Lord Wyman Manderly is mockingly called ""Lord Lamprey"" by his enemies in reference to his rumored affinity to lamprey pie and his striking [obesity] obesity . 
[Kurt Vonnegut] Kurt Vonnegut , in his late short story "" [The Big Space Fuck] The Big Space Fuck "", posits a future America so heavily polluted – ""Everything had turned to shit and beer cans"", in his words – that the Great Lakes have been infested with a species of massive, man-eating ambulatory lampreys. 
=== In television ===
In season 3, episode 5 of "" [The Borgias] The Borgias "", whilst out on a hunting trip, [Cesare Borgia] Cesare Borgia 's mercenary, Micheletto, kills the King of Naples by pushing him into a pool filled with lampreys that King Ferrante had built during his reign of Naples. 
In season 9, episode 16, of ""Bones"" (American TV series from 2005-2017), Agent Booth grabs a lamprey that is escaping from a bag holding a dead body which has been found in a pond. Later, two lamprey are seen in Hodgins' lab.

Tasmanian Tiger,Thylacine,"
The thylacine thylacine ( [/ˈθaɪləsiːn/] / ˈ ˈ θ θ aɪ aɪ l l ə ə s s iː iː n n / ; [binomial name] binomial name  Thylacinus cynocephalus Thylacinus cynocephalus Thylacinus cynocephalus ), also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf Tasmanian wolf , is an [extinct] extinct carnivorous [marsupial] marsupial that was native to the [Australian mainland] Australian mainland and the islands of [Tasmania] Tasmania and [New Guinea] New Guinea . The thylacine died out in New Guinea and mainland Australia around 3,600–3,200 years ago, prior to the arrival of Europeans, possibly because of the introduction of the [dingo] dingo , whose earliest record dates to around the same time, but which never reached Tasmania. Prior to European settlement, around 5,000 remained in the wild on Tasmania. Beginning in the nineteenth century, they were perceived as a threat to the livestock of farmers and [bounty hunting] bounty hunting was introduced. The last known of its species died in 1936 at [Hobart Zoo] Hobart Zoo in Tasmania. The thylacine is widespread in popular culture and is a [cultural icon] cultural icon in Australia.
The thylacine was known as the Tasmanian tiger because of the dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, and it was called the Tasmanian wolf because it resembled a medium- to large-sized [canid] canid . The name thylacine is derived from thýlakos thýlakos meaning ""pouch"" and ine ine meaning ""pertaining to"", and refers to the [marsupial pouch] marsupial pouch . Both sexes had a pouch. The females used theirs for rearing young, and the males used theirs as a protective sheath, covering the [external reproductive organs] external reproductive organs . The animal had a stiff tail and could open its jaws to an unusual extent. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence on its predatory behaviour suggest that the thylacine was a solitary [ambush predator] ambush predator specialised in hunting small- to medium-sized prey. Accounts suggest that, in the wild, it fed on small birds and mammals. It was the only member of the genus Thylacinus [Thylacinus] Thylacinus and family [Thylacinidae] Thylacinidae to have survived until modern times. Its closest living relatives are the other members of [Dasyuromorphia] Dasyuromorphia , including the [Tasmanian devil] Tasmanian devil , from which it is estimated to have split 42–36 million years ago.
Intensive hunting on Tasmania is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors were disease, the introduction of and competition with dingoes, human [encroachment] encroachment into its habitat and [climate change] climate change . The remains of the last known thylacine were discovered at the [Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery] Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 2022. Since extinction there have been numerous searches and reported sightings of live animals, none of which have been confirmed.
The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official [coat of arms of Tasmania] coat of arms of Tasmania . Since 1996, National Threatened Species Day has been commemorated in Australia on 7 September, the date on which the last known thylacine died in 1936. Universities, museums and other institutions across the world research the animal. Its [whole genome sequence] whole genome sequence has been mapped, and there are efforts to [clone] clone and bring it back to life. 
== Taxonomic and evolutionary history ==
Numerous examples of thylacine engravings and [rock art] rock art have been found, dating back to at least 1000 BC.  [Petroglyph] Petroglyph images of the thylacine can be found at the Dampier Rock Art Precinct, on the [Burrup Peninsula] Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. 
By the time the first European explorers arrived, the animal was already extinct in mainland Australia and New Guinea and rare in Tasmania. Europeans may have encountered it in Tasmania as far back as 1642, when [Abel Tasman] Abel Tasman first arrived in Tasmania. His shore party reported seeing the footprints of ""wild beasts having claws like a Tyger Tyger "".  [Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne] Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne , arriving with the Mascarin Mascarin in 1772, reported seeing a ""tiger cat"". 
The first definitive encounter was by French explorers on 13 May 1792, as noted by the naturalist [Jacques Labillardière] Jacques Labillardière , in his journal from the expedition led by [d'Entrecasteaux] d'Entrecasteaux . In 1805, [William Paterson] William Paterson , the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania, sent a detailed description for publication in the Sydney Gazette [Sydney Gazette] Sydney Gazette . He also sent a description of the thylacine in a letter to [Joseph Banks] Joseph Banks , dated 30 March 1805. 
The first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania's Deputy Surveyor-General, [George Harris] George Harris , in 1808, five years after first European settlement of the island. Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus Didelphis [Didelphis] Didelphis , which had been created by [Linnaeus] Linnaeus for the American [opossums] opossums , describing it as Didelphis cynocephala Didelphis cynocephala , the ""dog-headed opossum"". Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern classification scheme, and in 1796, [Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire] Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire created the genus Dasyurus [Dasyurus] Dasyurus , where he placed the thylacine in 1810. To maintain [gender agreement] gender agreement with the genus name, the species name was altered to cynocephalus cynocephalus . In 1824, it was separated out into its own genus, Thylacinus Thylacinus , by [Temminck] Temminck . The common name derives directly from the genus name, originally from the Greek θύλακος θύλακος θύλακος ( thýlakos thýlakos thýlakos ), meaning ""pouch"" or ""sack"" and ine ine meaning ""pertaining to"". The name is pronounced [THY-lə-seen] THY THY -lə-seen or [THY-lə-syne] THY THY -lə-syne . 
=== Evolution ===
The earliest records of the modern thylacine are from the [Early Pleistocene] Early Pleistocene , with the oldest known fossil record in southeastern Australia from the [Calabrian] Calabrian age around 1.77–0.78 million years ago. Specimens from the [Pliocene] Pliocene -aged Chinchilla Fauna, described as Thylacinus rostralis Thylacinus rostralis by [Charles De Vis] Charles De Vis in 1894, have in the past been suggested to represent Thylacinus cynocephalus Thylacinus cynocephalus , but have been shown to either have been curatorial errors, or ambiguous in their specific attribution. The family [Thylacinidae] Thylacinidae includes at least 12 species in eight genera. Thylacinids are estimated to have split from other members of [Dasyuromorphia] Dasyuromorphia around 42–36 million years ago. The earliest representative of the family is Badjcinus turnbulli [Badjcinus turnbulli] Badjcinus turnbulli from the Late Oligocene of [Riversleigh] Riversleigh in Queensland, around 25 million years ago. Early thylacinids were [quoll] quoll -sized, well under 10 kg (22 lb). It probably ate insects and small reptiles and mammals, although signs of an increasingly-carnivorous diet can be seen as early as the early [Miocene] Miocene in Wabulacinus [Wabulacinus] Wabulacinus . Members of the genus Thylacinus [Thylacinus] Thylacinus are notable for a dramatic increase in both the expression of carnivorous dental traits and in size, with the largest species, Thylacinus potens [Thylacinus potens] Thylacinus potens and Thylacinus megiriani [Thylacinus megiriani] Thylacinus megiriani , both approaching the size of a wolf. In [late Pleistocene] late Pleistocene and early [Holocene] Holocene times, the modern thylacine was widespread (although never numerous) throughout Australia and New Guinea. 
A classic example of [convergent evolution] convergent evolution , the thylacine showed many similarities to the members of the dog family, [Canidae] Canidae , of the Northern Hemisphere: sharp teeth, powerful jaws, [raised heels] raised heels , and the same general body form. Since the thylacine filled the same [ecological niche] ecological niche in Australia and New Guinea as canids did elsewhere, it developed many of the same features. Despite this, as a marsupial, it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere [placental mammal] placental mammal predators. 
The thylacine is a [basal] basal member of the [Dasyuromorphia] Dasyuromorphia , along with [numbats] numbats , [dunnarts] dunnarts , [wambengers] wambengers , and quolls. The [cladogram] cladogram follows:

== Description ==
The only recorded species of Thylacinus [Thylacinus] Thylacinus , a genus that superficially resembles the dogs and foxes of the family [Canidae] Canidae , the animal was a predatory marsupial that existed on mainland Australia during the Holocene epoch and was observed by Europeans on the island of Tasmania; the species is known as the Tasmanian tiger for the striped markings of the [pelage] pelage . Descriptions of the thylacine come from preserved specimens, fossil records, skins and skeletal remains, and black and white photographs and film of the animal both in captivity and from the field. The thylacine resembled a large, short-haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended from the body in a way similar to that of a [kangaroo] kangaroo . The mature thylacine measured about 60 cm (24 in) in shoulder height and 1–1.3 m (3.3–4.3 ft) in body length, excluding the tail which measured around 50 to 65 cm (20 to 26 in). Because the recorded body mass estimates are scant, it has been suggested that they may have weighed anywhere from 15 to 35 kg (33 to 77 lb), but a 2020 study that examined 93 adult specimens, with 40 of the specimens' sexes being known, argued that their average body mass would be 16.7 kg (37 lb) with a range of 9.8–28.1 kg (22–62 lb) based on volumetric analysis. There was slight [sexual dimorphism] sexual dimorphism , with the males being larger than females on average. Males weighed on average 19.7 kg (43 lb), and females on average weighed 13.7 kg (30 lb). The skull is noted to be highly convergent on those of canids, most closely resembling that of the [red fox] red fox . 
Thylacines, uniquely for marsupials, had largely cartilaginous [epipubic bones] epipubic bones with a highly reduced [osseous] osseous element. This was once considered a [synapomorphy] synapomorphy with [sparassodonts] sparassodonts , though it is now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently. Its yellow-brown coat featured 15 to 20 distinctive dark stripes across its back, rump and the base of its tail, which earned the animal the nickname ""tiger"". The stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens, fading as the animal got older. One of the stripes extended down the outside of the rear thigh. Its body hair was dense and soft, up to 15 mm (0.59 in) in length. Colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown; the belly was cream-coloured. 
Its rounded, erect ears were about 8 cm (3.1 in) long and covered with short fur. The early scientific studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey, but analysis of its brain structure revealed that its [olfactory bulbs] olfactory bulbs were not well developed. It is likely to have relied on sight and sound when hunting instead. In 2017, Berns and Ashwell published comparative [cortical maps] cortical maps of thylacine and Tasmanian devil brains, showing that the thylacine had a larger, more modularised [basal ganglion] basal ganglion . The authors associated these differences with the thylacine's more predatory lifestyle. Analysis of the forebrain published in 2023 suggested that it was similar in morphology to other dasyuromorph marsupials and dissimilar to that of canids. 
The thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent: up to 80 degrees. This capability can be seen in part in [David Fleay] David Fleay 's short black-and-white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933. The jaws were muscular, and had 46 teeth, but studies show the thylacine jaw was too weak to kill sheep. The tail vertebrae were fused to a degree, with resulting restriction of full tail movement. Fusion may have occurred as the animal reached full maturity. The tail tapered towards the tip. In juveniles, the tip of the tail had a ridge. The female thylacine had a pouch with four [teats] teats , but unlike many other marsupials, the pouch opened to the rear of its body. Males had a scrotal pouch, unique amongst the Australian marsupials, into which they could withdraw their [scrotal sac] scrotal sac for protection. 
Thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals; unlike foxes, cats, dogs, [wombats] wombats , or [Tasmanian devils] Tasmanian devils , thylacines had a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads, arranged in almost a straight line. The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than five. Their claws were non-retractable. The plantar pad is tri-lobal in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes. It is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves. The distinctive plantar pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes. 
The thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward [gait] gait , making it unable to run at high speed. It could also perform a bipedal hop, in a fashion similar to a kangaroo—demonstrated at various times by captive specimens. Guiler speculates that this was used as an accelerated form of motion when the animal became alarmed. The animal was also able to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods. 
Observers of the animal in the wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated, often accompanied by a threat-yawn. During hunting, it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough-like barks (described as ""yip-yap"", ""cay-yip"" or ""hop-hop-hop""), probably for communication between the family pack members. It also had a long whining cry, probably for identification at distance, and a low snuffling noise used for communication between family members. Some observers described it as having a strong and distinctive smell, others described a faint, clean, animal odour, and some no odour at all. It is possible that the thylacine, like its relative, the Tasmanian devil, gave off an odour when agitated. 
== Distribution and habitat ==
The thylacine most likely preferred the [dry eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and grasslands] dry eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and grasslands of [mainland Australia] mainland Australia . Indigenous Australian rock paintings indicate that the thylacine lived throughout mainland Australia and [New Guinea] New Guinea . Proof of the animal's existence in mainland Australia came from a [desiccated] desiccated carcass that was discovered in a cave in the [Nullarbor Plain] Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia in 1990; [carbon dating] carbon dating revealed it to be around 3,300 years old. Recently examined fossilised footprints also suggest historical distribution of the species on [Kangaroo Island] Kangaroo Island . The northernmost record of the species is from the Kiowa rock shelter in [Chimbu Province] Chimbu Province in the [highlands] highlands of [Papua New Guinea] Papua New Guinea , dating to the Early Holocene, around 10,000–8,500 years [Before Present] Before Present . In 2017, White, Mitchell and Austin published a large-scale analysis of thylacine mitochondrial genomes, showing that they had split into eastern and western populations on the mainland prior to the [Last Glacial Maximum] Last Glacial Maximum and that Tasmanian thylacines had a low genetic diversity by the time of European arrival. 
In Tasmania, they preferred the woodlands of the midlands and coastal [heath] heath , which eventually became the primary focus of British settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock. The striped pattern may have provided camouflage in woodland conditions, but it may have also served for identification purposes. The species had a typical home range of between 40 and 80 km (15 and 31 sq mi). It appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial; groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together. 
== Ecology and behaviour ==
=== Reproduction ===
There is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year), although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring. They would produce up to four joeys per litter (typically two or three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size. Early pouch young were hairless and blind, but they had their eyes open and were fully furred by the time they left the pouch. The young also had their own pouches that were not visible until they were 9.5 weeks old. After leaving the pouch, and until they were developed enough to assist, the juveniles would remain in the lair while their mother hunted. Thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity, in [Melbourne Zoo] Melbourne Zoo in 1899. Their life expectancy in the wild is estimated to have been 5 to 7 years, although captive specimens survived up to 9 years. 
In 2018, Newton et al. collected and CT-scanned all known preserved thylacine pouch young specimens to digitally reconstruct their development throughout their entire window of growth in their mother's pouch. This study revealed new information on the biology of the thylacine, including the growth of its limbs and when it developed its 'dog-like' appearance. It was found that two of the thylacine young in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) were misidentified and of another species, reducing the number of known pouch young specimens to 11 worldwide. One of four specimens kept at Museum Victoria has been serially sectioned, allowing an in-depth investigation of its internal tissues and providing some insights into thylacine pouch young development, biology, immunology and ecology. 
=== Feeding and diet ===
The thylacine was an [apex predator] apex predator , though exactly how large its prey animals could be is disputed. It was a [nocturnal] nocturnal and [crepuscular] crepuscular hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark, or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night. Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact, although it occasionally showed inquisitive traits. At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its ""fierce"" nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture. 
Historical accounts suggest that in the wild, the thylacine preyed on small mammals and birds, with waterbirds being the most commonly recorded bird prey, with historical accounts of thylacines predating on [black ducks] black ducks and [teals] teals with [coots] coots , [Tasmanian nativehens] Tasmanian nativehens , [swamphens] swamphens , herons ( Ardea [Ardea] Ardea ) and [black swans] black swans also being likely items of prey. The thylacine may also have preyed upon the now extinct [Tasmanian emu] Tasmanian emu . The most commonly recorded mammalian prey was the [red-necked wallaby] red-necked wallaby , with other recorded prey including the [Tasmanian pademelon] Tasmanian pademelon and the [short-beaked echidna] short-beaked echidna . Other probable native mammalian prey includes other marsupials like [bandicoots] bandicoots and [brushtail possums] brushtail possums , as well as native rodents like [water rats] water rats . Following their introduction to Tasmania, European rabbits rapidly multiplied and became abundant across the island, with a number of accounts reporting the predation of rabbits by thylacines. Some accounts also suggest that the thylacine may have preyed on lizards, frogs and fish. 
European settlers believed the thylacine to prey regularly upon farmers' sheep and poultry. However, analysis by Robert Paddle suggests that there is little evidence that thylacines were significant predators of sheep or poultry (though some accounts suggest that they may have attacked them on occasion), with many sheep deaths likely caused by feral dog attacks instead. Throughout the 20th century, the thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker; according to Robert Paddle, the story's popularity seems to have originated from a single second-hand account heard by Geoffrey Smith (1881–1916) in a shepherd's hut. 
Recent studies suggest that the thylacine was probably not suited for hunting large prey. A 2007 study argued that, while it could open its jaws wide like modern mammalian predators that consume large prey, the canine of the thylacine was not suited for slashing bites like that of large canids, indicating, based on the assumption that the bite was largely derived by its skull, that it hunted small to medium-sized prey as a solitary hunter. A 2011 study by the [University of New South Wales] University of New South Wales using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws; animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around 30 kg (66 lb) was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than 5 kg (11 lb), suggesting that the thylacine only ate smaller animals such as bandicoots, pademelons and possums, and that it may have directly competed with the [Tasmanian devil] Tasmanian devil and the [tiger quoll] tiger quoll . Another study in 2020 produced similar results, after estimating the average body mass of thylacine as about 16.7 kg (37 lb) rather than 30 kg (66 lb), suggesting that the animal did indeed hunt much smaller prey. The cranial and facial morphology also indicate that the thylacine would have hunted prey less than 45% of its own body mass, consistent with modern carnivores weighing under 21 kg (46 lb) which is about the average size of a thylacine. 
A 2005 study showed that the thylacine had a high [bite force quotient] bite force quotient of 166, which was similar to that of most quolls, indicating that it may have been able to hunt larger prey relative to its body size. A 2007 study also suggested that it would have had a much stronger bite force than a dingo of similar size, though this particular study argued that the thylacine would have hunted smaller prey. A biomechanical analysis of the 3D skull model suggested that the thylacine would have likely consumed smaller prey, with its skull displaying high levels of stress that are not suited to withstand forces, and with its bite forces being estimated at a smaller value than that of Tasmanian devils. A 2014 study compared the skull of a thylacine with that of modern [dasyurids] dasyurids and an earlier [thylacinid] thylacinid taxon Nimbacinus [Nimbacinus] Nimbacinus based on biomechanical analysis of their 3D skull models; the authors suggested that while Nimbacinus Nimbacinus was suited to hunt large prey with a maximum muscle force of 651 N (146 lb f f ) which are similar to that of large Tasmanian devils, the thylacine skull displayed a much higher stress in all areas compared to its relatives due to its longer snout. If the thylacine were indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem. 
It has been suggested on the basis of the canine teeth and limb bones that the thylacine was a solitary [pounce-pursuit predator] pounce-pursuit predator that hunted smaller prey with trophic niches similar to relatively smaller canids like the [coyote] coyote , and that it was not as specialised as large canids, hyaenids and felids of today: its canine lacked the adaptation for producing slashing or deep penetrating bites, and its anatomy was not suited for running fast in high speed. However, the trappers reported it as an [ambush predator] ambush predator hunting alone or in pairs mainly at night. The elbow joint morphology and the forelimb anatomy of the thylacine also suggest that the animal was most likely an ambush predator. 
The [stomach] stomach of a thylacine was very muscular, capable of distending to allow the animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. In captivity, thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods, including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef, mutton, horse and, occasionally, poultry. There is a report of a captive thylacine that refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it, but ""ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed [wallaby] wallaby put before its nose."" 
== Extinction ==
=== Dying out on the Australian mainland ===
Australia lost more than 90% of [its megafauna] its megafauna around 50–40,000 years ago as part of the [Quaternary extinction event] Quaternary extinction event , with the notable exceptions of several kangaroo and wombat species, emus, cassowaries, large [goannas] goannas , and the thylacine. The extinctions included the even larger carnivore Thylacoleo carnifex [Thylacoleo carnifex] Thylacoleo carnifex (sometimes called the marsupial lion) which was only distantly related to the thylacine. A 2010 paper examining this issue showed that humans were likely to be one of the major factors in the extinction of many species in Australia although the authors of the research warned that one-factor explanations might be over-simplistic. The youngest radiocarbon dates of the thylacine in mainland Australia are around 3,500 years old, with an estimated extinction date around 3,200 years ago, synchronous with that of Tasmanian devil, and closely co-inciding with the earliest records of the [dingo] dingo , as well as an intensification of human activity. 
A study proposes that the dingo may have led to the extinction of the thylacine in mainland Australia because the dingo outcompeted the thylacine in preying on the [Tasmanian nativehen] Tasmanian nativehen . The dingo is also more likely to hunt in packs than the more solitary thylacine. Examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite, its skull could resist greater stresses, allowing it to pull down larger prey than the thylacine. Because it was a [hypercarnivore] hypercarnivore , the thylacine was less versatile in its diet than the omnivorous [dingo] dingo . Their ranges appear to have overlapped because thylacine [subfossil] subfossil remains have been discovered near those of dingoes. Aside from wild dingoes, the adoption of the dingo as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the thylacine under increased pressure. 
A 2013 study suggested that, while dingoes were a contributing factor to the thylacine's demise on the mainland, larger factors were the intense human population growth, technological advances, and the abrupt change in the climate during the period. A report published in the Journal of Biogeography Journal of Biogeography detailed an investigation into the [mitochondrial DNA] mitochondrial DNA and radio-carbon dating of thylacine bones. It concluded that the thylacine died out on mainland Australia in a relatively short time span. 
Ken Mulvaney has suggested, based on the high number of rock carvings of the thylacine on the [Burrup Peninsula] Burrup Peninsula , Aboriginal Australians were aware of, and concerned about the thylacine’s dwindling numbers around that time. 
=== Dying out on Tasmania ===
Although the thylacine had died out on mainland Australia, it survived into the 1930s on the island of [Tasmania] Tasmania . At the time of the first European settlement, the heaviest distributions were in the northeast, northwest and north-midland regions of the state. There were an estimated 5,000 at the time. They were rarely sighted but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep. This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers. The [Van Diemen's Land Company] Van Diemen's Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830, and between 1888 and 1909, the [Tasmanian government] Tasmanian government paid £1 per head for dead adult thylacines and ten [shillings] shillings for pups. In all, they paid out 2,184 bounties, but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for. Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and [bounty hunters] bounty hunters . 
Aside from persecution, it is likely that multiple factors rapidly compounded its decline and eventual extinction, including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, erosion of its habitat, already-low genetic diversity, the concurrent extinction or decline of prey species, and a [distemper] distemper -like disease that affected many captive specimens at the time. A study from 2012 suggested that the disease was likely introduced by humans, and that it was also present in the wild population. The marsupi-carnivore disease, as it became known, dramatically reduced the lifespan of the animal and greatly increased pup mortality. 
A 1921 photo by [Henry Burrell] Henry Burrell of a thylacine with a chicken was widely distributed and may have helped secure the animal's reputation as a poultry thief. The image had been cropped to hide the fact that the animal was in captivity, and analysis by one researcher has concluded that this thylacine was a [dead specimen] dead specimen , posed for the camera. The photograph may even have involved [photo manipulation] photo manipulation . 
The animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s. Despite the fact that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep, in 1928 the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve similar to the [Savage River National Park] Savage River National Park to protect any remaining thylacines, with potential sites of suitable habitat including the [Arthur] Arthur - [Pieman] Pieman area of western Tasmania. 
By the beginning of the 20th century, the increasing rarity of thylacines led to increased demand for captive specimens by zoos around the world, placing yet more pressure on an already small population. Despite the export of breeding pairs, attempts at rearing thylacines in captivity were unsuccessful, and the last thylacine outside Australia died at the [London Zoo] London Zoo in 1931. 
The last known thylacine to be killed in the wild was shot in 1930 by Wilf Batty, a farmer from [Mawbanna] Mawbanna in the state's northwest. The animal, believed to have been a male, had been seen around Batty's house for several weeks. 
Work in 2012 examined the relationship of the genetic diversity of the thylacines before their extinction. The results indicated that the last of the thylacines in Tasmania had limited genetic diversity due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia. Further investigations in 2017 showed evidence that this decline in genetic diversity started long before the arrival of humans in Australia, possibly starting as early as 70–120 thousand years ago. 
The thylacine held the status of [endangered species] endangered species until the 1980s. International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record. Since no definitive proof of the thylacine's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years, it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature] International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1982 and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( [CITES] CITES ) in 2013. 
=== Last of the species ===
The last captive thylacine, lived as an [endling] endling (the known last of its species) at [Hobart Zoo] Hobart Zoo until its death on the night of 7 September 1936. The animal, a male, was captured by Elias Churchill with a [snare trap] snare trap and was sold to the zoo in May 1936. The sale was not publicly announced because the use of traps was illegal and Churchill could have been fined. After its death, the remains of the endling were transferred to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. The remains were not properly recorded by the museum because the animal had been caught illegally. It lay undiscovered for decades until a taxidermist record dated from 1936 or 1937 mentioning the animal was noticed. This led to a full audit of all thylacine remains at the museum and the endling's successful identification at the end of 2022. 
In 1968, Frank Darby invented a myth that the endling was called Benjamin. The myth was widely circulated in the media, with Wikipedia itself repeating the invention. The thylacine that Darby was referring to was a male at Hobart Zoo. This animal is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. This thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen: 45 seconds of black-and-white footage showing the thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933, by naturalist [David Fleay] David Fleay . In the film footage, the thylacine is seen seated, walking around the perimeter of its enclosure, yawning, sniffing the air, scratching itself (in the same manner as a dog), and lying down. Fleay was bitten on the buttock whilst shooting the film. In 2021, a digitally colourised 80-second clip of Fleay's footage of the thylacine was released by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, to mark National Threatened Species Day. The digital colourisation process was based on historic primary and secondary descriptions to ensure an accurate colour match. 
Although there had been a [conservation movement] conservation movement pressing for the thylacine's protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government came all too late; it was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity. 
=== Searches and unconfirmed sightings ===
Between 1967 and 1973, zoologist [Jeremy Griffith] Jeremy Griffith and dairy farmer James Malley conducted what is regarded as the most intensive search for thylacines ever carried out, including exhaustive surveys along Tasmania's west coast, installation of automatic camera stations, prompt investigations of claimed sightings, and in 1972 the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr. [Bob Brown] Bob Brown , which concluded without finding any evidence of the thylacine's existence. 
The [Department of Conservation and Land Management] Department of Conservation and Land Management recorded 203 reports of sightings of the thylacine in Western Australia from 1936 to 1998. On the mainland, sightings are most frequently reported in Southern Victoria. 
According to the [Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment] Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment , there have been eight unconfirmed thylacine sighting reports between 2016 and 2019, with the latest unconfirmed visual sighting on 25 February 2018. 
Since the disappearance and effective extinction of the thylacine, speculation and searches for a living specimen have become a topic of interest to some members of the [cryptozoology] cryptozoology subculture. The search for the animal has been the subject of books and articles, with many reported sightings that are largely regarded as dubious. 
A 2023 study published by [Brook] Brook et al. compiles many of the alleged sightings of thylacines in Tasmania throughout the 20th century and claims that, contrary to beliefs that the thylacine went extinct in the 1930s, the Tasmanian thylacine may have actually lasted throughout the 20th century, with a window of extinction between the 1980s and the present day and the likely extinction date being between the late 1990s and early 2000s. 
In 1983, the American [media mogul] media mogul  [Ted Turner] Ted Turner offered a $100,000 reward for proof of the continued existence of the thylacine. In March 2005, Australian news magazine The Bulletin [The Bulletin] The Bulletin , as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations, offered a $1.25 million reward for the safe capture of a live thylacine. When the offer closed at the end of June 2005, no one had produced any evidence of the animal's existence. An offer of $1.75 million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian tour operator, Stewart Malcolm. 
== Research ==
Research into thylacines relies heavily on specimens held in museums and other institutions across the world. The number and distribution of these specimens has been recorded in the [International Thylacine Specimen Database] International Thylacine Specimen Database . As of 2022, 756 specimens are held in 115 museums and university collections in 23 countries. In 2017, a reference library of 159 micrographic images of thylacine hair was jointly produced by [CSIRO] CSIRO and Where Light Meets Dark. 
=== Cloning ===
The [Australian Museum] Australian Museum in Sydney began a [cloning] cloning project in 1999. The goal was to use [genetic material] genetic material from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to [clone] clone new individuals and [restore] restore the species from extinction. Several molecular biologists dismissed the project as a public relations stunt. In late 2002, the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable [DNA] DNA from the specimens. On 15 February 2005, the museum announced that it was stopping the project. In May 2005, the project was restarted by a group of interested universities and a research institute. 
In August 2022, it was announced that the [University of Melbourne] University of Melbourne would partner with Texas-based biotechnology company [Colossal Biosciences] Colossal Biosciences to attempt to re-create the thylacine using its closest living relative, the [fat-tailed dunnart] fat-tailed dunnart , and return it to Tasmania. The university had recently sequenced the genome of a juvenile thylacine specimen and was establishing a thylacine genetic restoration laboratory. The research from the University of Melbourne was led by Andrew Pask. The project was regarded with skepticism by other, uninvolved scientists. 
=== DNA sequencing ===
A draft [whole genome sequencing] whole genome sequencing of the thylacine was produced by Feigin et al. (2017) using the DNA extracted from an ethanol-preserved pouch of a young specimen provided by [Museums Victoria] Museums Victoria . The neonatal development of the thylacine was also reconstructed from preserved pouch young specimens from several museum collections. Researchers used the genome to study aspects of the thylacine's evolution and natural history, including the genetic basis of its [convergence] convergence with [canids] canids , clarifying its [evolutionary relationships] evolutionary relationships with other marsupials and examining changes in its [population size] population size over time. 
The genomic basis of the convergent evolution between the thylacine and grey wolf was further investigated in 2019, with researchers identifying many [non-coding] non-coding genomic regions displaying accelerated rates of evolution, a test for genetic regions evolving under [positive selection] positive selection . In 2021, researchers further identified a link between the convergent skull shapes of the thylacine and wolf, and the previously identified genetic candidates. It was reported that specific groups of skull bones, which develop from a common population of stem cells called [neural crest] neural crest cells, showed strong similarity between the thylacine and wolf and corresponded with the underlying convergent genetic candidates which influence these cells during development. In 2023, RNA was extracted from a 130-year-old thylacine specimen in Sweden; this represented the first time RNA has been extracted from an extinct species. In 2024, a 99.9% thylacine [genome] genome was sequenced from a well-preserved skull that is estimated to be 110-year-old. 
== Cultural significance ==
=== Official usage ===
The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official [Tasmanian coat of arms] Tasmanian coat of arms . It is used in the official logos for the [Tasmanian government] Tasmanian government and the [City of Launceston] City of Launceston . It is also used on the [University of Tasmania] University of Tasmania 's ceremonial mace and the [badge] badge of the submarine [HMASDechaineux] HMAS Dechaineux Dechaineux . Since 1998, it has been prominently displayed on [Tasmanian vehicle number plates] Tasmanian vehicle number plates . The thylacine has appeared in postage stamps from Australia, [Equatorial Guinea] Equatorial Guinea , and [Micronesia] Micronesia . 
Since 1996, 7 September (the date in 1936 on which the last known thylacine died) has been commemorated in Australia as National Threatened Species Day. 
=== In popular culture ===
The thylacine has become a cultural icon in Australia. The best known illustrations of Thylacinus cynocephalus Thylacinus cynocephalus were those in [John Gould] John Gould 's The Mammals of Australia [The Mammals of Australia] The Mammals of Australia (1845–1863), often copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced, and given further exposure by [Cascade Brewery] Cascade Brewery 's appropriation for its label in 1987. The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934, the author [Louisa Anne Meredith] Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for Tasmanian Friends and Foes Tasmanian Friends and Foes (1881). The thylacine is the mascot for the [Tasmanian cricket team] Tasmanian cricket team . A series of [postage stamps] postage stamps that feature [Mickey Mouse] Mickey Mouse characters with Australian animals features a thylacine stamp in the collection. 
In video games, boomerang-wielding Ty the Tasmanian Tiger [Ty the Tasmanian Tiger] Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is the star of his own trilogy during the 2000s.  [Tiny Tiger] Tiny Tiger , a villain in the popular Crash Bandicoot [Crash Bandicoot] Crash Bandicoot video game series, is a mutated thylacine. In Valorant [Valorant] Valorant , agent Skye has the ability to use a Tasmanian tiger to scout enemies and clear bomb-planting sites. 
The animal has made appearance in film and television. Characters in the early 1990s' cartoon Taz-Mania [Taz-Mania] Taz-Mania included the neurotic Wendell T. Wolf, the last surviving Tasmanian wolf.  The Hunter [The Hunter] The Hunter is a 2011 Australian drama film, based on the [1999 novel of the same name] 1999 novel of the same name by [Julia Leigh] Julia Leigh . It stars [Willem Dafoe] Willem Dafoe , who plays a man hired to track down the Tasmanian tiger. In the 2021 film, Extinct [Extinct] Extinct , a thylacine named Burnie, along with a group of other extinct animals, help the movie's main characters travel through time to rescue their species from extinction. In the 2022 science-fiction show [The Peripheral] The Peripheral The Peripheral the Tasmanian tiger is brought back into existence from DNA extracts. An animated [web series] web series titled ""De-extincting Tasie"" meant to explain the revival of the species by Colossal Biosciences and University of Melbourne features a thylacine named Tasie, a satire of the [Mr. DNA] Mr. DNA character from the [Jurassic Park] Jurassic Park media franchise. 
=== In Aboriginal tradition ===
Rock art featuring Thylacine-like animals are found throughout Northern Australia, particularly in the [Kimberley] Kimberley region. 
Various [Aboriginal Tasmanian] Aboriginal Tasmanian names for the thylacine have been recorded, such as coorinna coorinna , kanunnah kanunnah , cab-berr-one-nen-er cab-berr-one-nen-er , loarinna loarinna , laoonana laoonana , can-nen-ner can-nen-ner and lagunta lagunta , while kaparunina kaparunina is used in [Palawa kani] Palawa kani . 
One Nuenonne myth recorded by Jackson Cotton tells of a thylacine pup saving Palana, a spirit boy, from an attack by a giant kangaroo. Palana marked the pup's back with ochre as a mark of its bravery, giving thylacines their stripes. A constellation, ""Wurrawana Corinna"" (identified as within or near [Gemini] Gemini ), was also created as a commemoration of this mythic act of bravery. 
An early European record tells how Aboriginals believed bad weather was caused by a Thylacine carcass being left exposed on the ground, instead of being covered by a small shelter.

Megamouth Shark,Megamouth shark,"
The megamouth shark megamouth shark ( Megachasma pelagios Megachasma pelagios Megachasma pelagios ) is a species of deepwater [shark] shark . Rarely seen by humans, it measures around 5.2 m (17 ft) long and is the smallest of the three [extant] extant  [filter-feeding] filter-feeding sharks alongside the relatively larger [whale shark] whale shark and [basking shark] basking shark . According to Sharkman's World Organization a total of 286 specimens have been observed or caught since its discovery in 1976. Like the other two [planktivorous] planktivorous sharks, it swims with its mouth wide open, filtering water for [plankton] plankton and jellyfish. It is recognizable from its large head with rubbery lips. The megamouth is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the family [Megachasmidae] Megachasmidae , though some scientists have suggested it may belong in the family [Cetorhinidae] Cetorhinidae . 
== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The first megamouth shark was captured on November 15, 1976, about 25 miles northeast of [Kahuku, Hawaii] Kahuku, Hawaii , when it became entangled in the [sea anchor] sea anchor of [United States Navy] United States Navy ship AFB-14 AFB-14 at a depth of about 165 m (541 ft). The species was identified as being of a new genus within the planktivorous shark species. Examination of the 4.5-meter (15 ft), 750-kilogram (1,650 lb) specimen by [Leighton Taylor] Leighton Taylor showed it to be an entirely unknown type of shark, making it – along with the [coelacanth] coelacanth – one of the more sensational discoveries in 20th-century [ichthyology] ichthyology . The pectoral fin of the megamouth shark was studied, along with its skeletal and muscular system, to show its phylogenetic relationship to the other two sharks. 
As of 5 March 2018 , only 99 megamouth specimens had been caught or sighted. They have been found in the [Pacific] Pacific , [Atlantic] Atlantic , and [Indian] Indian Oceans. Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each yielded at least 10 specimens, the most of any single area, amounting to more than half the worldwide total. Specimens have also been sighted in or come out of the waters near Hawaii, California, Mexico, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and possibly Vietnam.
Researchers have predicted the feeding patterns of megamouth sharks in relation to the other two planktivorous sharks; the three planktivorous sharks have [ram feeding] ram feeding in common, as it evolved from ram feeding swimming-type ancestors that developed their filtering mechanism to capture small prey like plankton. In addition to the living M. pelagios M. pelagios , however, two extinct megamouth species – the [Priabonian] Priabonian  M. alisonae [M. alisonae] M. alisonae and the [Oligocene] Oligocene – [Miocene] Miocene  M. applegatei [M. applegatei] M. applegatei – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. An early ancestor of the recent species Megachasma pelagios [Megachasma pelagios] Megachasma pelagios was reported from the early Miocene (Burdigalian) of Belgium. However, the Cretaceous-aged M. comanchensis M. comanchensis has been recently reclassified as an [odontaspid shark] odontaspid shark in the genus Pseudomegachasma [Pseudomegachasma] Pseudomegachasma , and is in fact unrelated to the megamouth shark despite similar teeth morphology. The megamouth's filter-feeding adaptations likely evolved independently from other extant filter-feeding sharks, even the lamniform basking shark, making it an example of [convergent evolution] convergent evolution . 
== Description ==
The appearance of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, similar to that of the [thresher shark] thresher shark . The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like [gill rakers] gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks [caudal keels] caudal keels . The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the [basking shark] basking shark and the [whale shark] whale shark . The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.
Megamouths are large sharks, able to grow to 5.49 metres (18 ft 0 in) in length. Mature males average at 4 m (13 ft) and females at 5 m (16 ft). Weights of up to 1,215 kg (2,679 lb) have been reported. A 2019 study suggested that it would have reached 6 m (20 ft) in maximum length. Megamouth sharks can be found as far northward as northern Japan; southern California (LACM 43745-1) and near Punta Eugenia, Baja California, and Hawaii. Megamouth sharks can be found at a depth of up to 1,000 m (3,280 ft). Megamouth sharks are dark blue, brownish-black, or gray above, lighter below; with a white band along the upper jaw; while the posterior margin of its fins are white.
As their name implies, megamouths have a large mouth with small teeth, and a broad, rounded snout, causing observers to occasionally mistake the megamouth for a young [orca] orca . The protruding inside of the upper lip is a brilliant silvery-white, which is very visible when the mouth is open. This lip was initially thought to be possibly embedded by luminous [photophores] photophores when the first shark was examined in the early 1980s, which may act as a lure for [plankton] plankton , while the team examining the second shark in the mid-1980s instead proposed that the lower lip might glow with the white band used as a reflector of sorts, but neither theory has been proven. In 2020, a study concluded that this species of shark does not in fact produce any light; the white band was found to merely be highly reflective of light. This white band is present in both sexes and could be either a feeding mechanism or possibly be used as a means of identifying other individuals of megamouth sharks. Their mouths can reach up to 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) in width. Megamouth sharks have up to 50 rows of teeth in their upper-jaw and up to 75 rows of teeth in their lower-jaw. 
== Behavior ==
In 1990, a 4.9-m (16-foot) male megamouth shark was caught near the surface off [Dana Point, California] Dana Point, California . This individual was eventually released with a small radio tag attached to its soft body. The tag relayed depth and time information over a two-day period. During the day, the shark swam at a depth around 120–160 m (390–520 ft), but as the sun set, it would ascend and spend the night at depths between 12 and 25 m (39 and 82 ft). Both day and night, its progress was very slow, around 1.5–2.1 km/h (0.81–1.13 kn). This pattern of vertical migration is seen in many marine animals as they track the movement of plankton in the [water column] water column . The shark captured in March 2009 was reportedly netted at a depth of 200 m (660 ft). 
== Reproduction ==
Reproduction is [ovoviviparous] ovoviviparous , meaning that the young sharks develop in eggs that remain within the mother's body until they hatch. Tissue samples were obtained from twenty-seven megamouths caught in a two-year period off the Hualien coast (eastern Taiwan), and two caught in Baja California, Mexico, and samples taken from GenBank to perform a population genetic analyses of the megamouth shark; the results indicated no genetic diversity between populations found in different geographical locations, which indicates the species forms a single, highly migratory, interbreeding population.

Oarfish,Oarfish,"
Oarfish Oarfish are large and extremely long [pelagic] pelagic  [lampriform] lampriform fish belonging to the small [family] family Regalecidae. Found in areas spanning from [temperate] temperate ocean zones to tropical ones, yet rarely seen, the oarfish family contains three [species] species in two [genera] genera . One of these, the [giant oarfish] giant oarfish ( Regalecus glesne Regalecus glesne ), is the longest [bony fish] bony fish alive, growing up to about 8 m (26 ft) in length. 
The [common name] common name  oarfish oarfish is thought to allude either to their highly compressed and elongated bodies, or to the now discredited belief that the fish ""row"" themselves through the water with their pelvic fins. The family name Regalecidae is derived from the [Latin] Latin  regalis regalis , meaning ""royal"". Although the larger species are considered [game fish] game fish and are fished commercially to a minor extent, oarfish are rarely caught alive; their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its [gelatinous] gelatinous consistency. 
Their rarity and large size, and their habit of lingering at the surface when sick or dying, make oarfish a probable source of [sea serpent] sea serpent tales. Their beachings after storms have gained them a reputation as harbingers of doom, a folk belief reinforced by the numerous beachings before the disastrous [2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami] 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami .
== Description ==
The dorsal fin originates from above the (relatively large) eyes and runs the entire length of the fish. Of the approximately 400 dorsal fin rays, the first 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees, forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of skin at the ray tips. The pelvic fins are similarly elongated and adorned, reduced to one to five rays each. The [pectoral fins] pectoral fins are greatly reduced and situated low on the body. The [anal fin] anal fin is completely absent and the [caudal fin] caudal fin may be reduced or absent as well, with the body tapering to a fine point. All fins lack true [spines] spines . At least one account, from researchers in New Zealand, described the oarfish as giving off ""electric shocks"" when touched. 
As in other members of its order, the mouth can be protruded. The body has no [scales] scales . In the streamer fish ( Agrostichthys parkeri [Agrostichthys parkeri] Agrostichthys parkeri ), the skin is clad with hard [tubercles] tubercles ; in R. russellii R. russellii , there are tubercules along the midline of the belly. 
All species lack [swim bladders] swim bladders , the number of [gill rakers] gill rakers is variable, but R. russellii R. russellii has more than R. glesne R. glesne . Oarfish are [silver in coloration] silver in coloration ; the body is marked with small dark spots. 
The giant oarfish is by far the largest member of the family, at a length of 8 m (26 ft)—with unconfirmed reports of specimens 11 m (36 ft) and 17 m (56 ft) in length and 270 kg (600 lb) in weight. The streamer fish reaches 3 m (9.8 ft) in length, while the largest recorded specimen of Regalecus russelii [Regalecus russelii] Regalecus russelii was 5.4 m (18 ft). 
Oarfish frequently practise [autotomy] autotomy , self-amputating the tail, presumably as an [anti-predator adaptation] anti-predator adaptation . All captured R. russellii R. russellii over 1.5 m long have autotomized tails; it is thought that they may autotomize their tails repeatedly. The break can occur near the tip of the tail so that only a part of the caudal fin is lost, or it may involve a few caudal vertebrae; in extreme cases the entire tail is lost. The wound heals but the tail does not regenerate. 
[Hyperostotic] Hyperostotic bone growth has been documented in several specimen of oarfish that have washed up on the coast of California. Hyperossified pterygiophores have been discovered to run along the entire dorsal length of oarfish. The function of this is to both provide structural support to the spine of oarfish during undulations (tail movement used for locomotion) and to remodel spines to prevent stress fractures that could occur from too much movement. It has also been hypothesized that this hyper ossification acts as a lever for the oarfish dorsal fins, which contributes to the organism's [buoyancy] buoyancy . Unlike many deep-sea fish, oarfish have no [swim bladders] swim bladders for maintaining depth in the water column. It is likely that this lack of a swim bladder forces more frequent tail undulations as the main mode of depth regulation in oarfish. 
== Evolution ==
=== Phylogeny ===
Through the analysis of the mitochondrial genome of Regalecus glesne Regalecus glesne , the phylogenetic placement of the giant oarfish was further verified. Oarfish are [Lampriformes] Lampriformes , so placed due to their morphology. Analysis of the mitochondrial genome of an R. glesne R. glesne specimen clusters the species with Trachipterus trachypterus [Trachipterus trachypterus] Trachipterus trachypterus and Zu cristatus [Zu cristatus] Zu cristatus , two other Lampriformes. 
=== Taxonomy ===
Oarfish were first described in 1772. Three extant species in two extant genera are described:
== Environment and distribution ==
The oarfish inhabits the [epipelagic] epipelagic to [mesopelagic] mesopelagic ocean layers, ranging from 250 meters (660 ft) to 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) and is rarely seen on the surface. A few have been found still barely alive, but usually if one floats to the surface, it dies due to depressurisation. At the depths the oarfish live, there are few or no currents. As a result, they build little muscle mass and they cannot survive in shallower turbulent water. 
The members of the family have a worldwide range, with tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate distributions. The oarfish typically reside in the [mesopelagic] mesopelagic area of the sea. However, human encounters with live oarfish are rare, and distribution information is collated from records of oarfish caught or washed ashore. 
== Ecology and life history ==
=== Behaviour ===
Rare encounters with divers and accidental catches have supplied what little is known of oarfish [ethology] ethology (behavior) and [ecology] ecology . In 2001, an oarfish was filmed alive in the wild. The 1.5-metre (4.9-foot) fish was spotted by a group of U.S. Navy personnel during the inspection of a buoy in the [Bahamas] Bahamas . The oarfish was observed to propel itself by an [amiiform] amiiform mode of swimming; that is, rhythmically undulating the dorsal fin while keeping the body itself straight. Perhaps indicating a feeding posture, oarfish have been observed swimming in a vertical orientation. In this posture, the downstreaming light would silhouette the oarfishes' prey, making them easier to spot. 
An oarfish measuring 3.3 m (11 ft) and 63.5 kg (140 lb) was caught in February 2003 using a [fishing rod] fishing rod  [baited] baited with [squid] squid at [Skinningrove] Skinningrove , [United Kingdom] United Kingdom . 
In July 2008, scientists for the first time captured footage of an oarfish swimming in its natural habitat in the [mesopelagic zone] mesopelagic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The fish was estimated to be between five and ten metres (16 and 33 ft) in length. As part of the SERPENT Project, five observations of apparently healthy oarfish Regalecus glesne Regalecus glesne by remotely operated vehicles were reported from the northern [Gulf of Mexico] Gulf of Mexico between 2008 and 2011 at depths within the [epipelagic] epipelagic and [mesopelagic] mesopelagic zones. These observations include the deepest verified record of R. glesne R. glesne (463–492 m or 1,519–1,614 ft). In the 2011 sighting, an oarfish has been observed to switch from swimming with a vertical posture to swimming laterally, using lateral undulations of its entire body. Oarfish were found to have late or slow flight responses towards approaching remotely operated vehicles, supporting the hypothesis that they have few natural predators. 
From December 2009 to March 2010, unusual numbers of the slender oarfish Regalecus russelii Regalecus russelii appeared in the waters and on the beaches of Japan. 
In 2016, [Animal Planet] Animal Planet aired an episode of the television series River Monsters [River Monsters] River Monsters named ""Deep Sea Demon"" in which [Jeremy Wade] Jeremy Wade was filmed with a live oarfish. The oarfish at this location seemed to be using a buoy anchor chain as a guide to ascend to the surface. On his second diving attempt, he filmed two live oarfish as they came relatively close to the surface. Wade was able to touch one of the oarfish with his hand. 
In January 2019 two oarfish were found alive in the nets of fishermen on the Japanese island of Okinawa. 
=== Feeding ecology ===
Oarfish feed primarily on [zooplankton] zooplankton , selectively straining tiny [euphausiids] euphausiids , [shrimp] shrimp , and other [crustaceans] crustaceans from the water. Small fish, [jellyfish] jellyfish , and [squid] squid are also taken. It has been observed that oarfish eat by suctioning prey such as plankton blooms while in the water. 
=== Life history ===
The [oceanodromous] oceanodromous  Regalecus glesne Regalecus glesne is recorded as [spawning] spawning off [Mexico] Mexico from July to December; all species are presumed to not guard their eggs, and release brightly coloured, buoyant [eggs] eggs , up to six millimetres (0.24 in) across, which are incorporated into the zooplankton. Based on their reproductive morphology, oarfish are thought to batch spawn. Within each breeding season that may last one or two months, individuals spawn once or multiple times in discrete spawning events before their gonads enter a long, regressive stage of reproductive development. 
The eggs hatch after about three weeks into highly active [larvae] larvae that feed on other zooplankton. The larvae have little resemblance to the adults, with long dorsal and pelvic fins and extensible mouths. Larvae and juveniles have been observed drifting just below the surface. In contrast, adult oarfish are rarely seen at the surface when not sick or injured. It is probable that the fishes go deeper as they mature. 
From January to February 2019, researchers tested and recorded the first successful instance of [artificial insemination] artificial insemination and hatching of the oarfish ( Regalecus russellii [Regalecus russellii] Regalecus russellii ) using gonads from two washed-up specimens. Compared to adults, the body structure of newly hatched oarfish larvae look more compressed. The larvae often swam using mainly their pectoral fins, facing downward, with their mouths constantly open. The larvae were invertebrates but had bones in their head area, as well as fins. They died of starvation four days after they hatched. 
In addition to the otolith, recent studies have revealed more information about the reproductive organs of the oarfish. Using photographs, histological cross-sections, and measurements of four samples of R. russelii R. russelii , researchers were able to qualitatively describe the sexual organs of the species. These studies have shown that female oarfish have bifurcated ovaries containing a cavity through which the eggs pass before leaving the body of the oarfish.  [Testes] Testes on male oarfish are located in a similar place as the [ovaries] ovaries of female oarfish, near the digestive tract called the [coelomic cavity] coelomic cavity . The oarfish have two separate, disconnected testes and the left testes observed were longer than the right testes. An analysis of these findings led researchers to conclude that R. russelii R. russelii are likely batch-spawning fish that produce a large number of offspring every breeding season. 
=== Reproduction ===
Little is known of the breeding habits of these fish. A single female can produce hundreds of thousands, to millions of eggs. It lays its eggs in the water column and they float freely in the water. 
=== Predators and parasites ===
A 2015 study suggested that the [shortfin mako shark] shortfin mako shark and the [sperm whale] sperm whale could both be predators of the oarfish, based on patterns of [parasite] parasite transmission and analysis of oarfish viscera. 
== In folklore ==
The slender oarfish, ( [竜] 竜 宮の使い ""Ryūgū-No-Tsukai""), known in [Japanese] Japanese  [folklore] folklore as the Messenger from the [Sea God's Palace] Sea God's Palace , is said to portend [earthquakes] earthquakes . The oarfish has been nicknamed the ""doomsday fish"" because, historically, appearances of the fish were linked with subsequent natural disasters, namely earthquakes or tsunamis. After the [2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami] 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which killed over 20,000 people, many in Japan pointed to the 20 oarfish washed up on the country's beaches in 2009 and 2010 in line with this reputation as a harbinger of doom.
